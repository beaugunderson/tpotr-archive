<h1>Racist <font size="1"><strong>(Giant Panda feat. Thes One)</strong></font></h1> 
<p><strong>Written by: Alex Newman, Jamaan McLaren, Chikara Kurahashi &amp; Christopher Portugal</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>[Thes One:] Chikara: are Japanese people, like, super good at karate, or are they, like… alright at karate…<br />
[Chikara:] Yeah, they're good, man.<br />
[Thes One:] They're good, for real? Everybody? Like old ladies… word… Ay-yo, Jamaan…<br />
[Maanumental:] What's up?<br />
[Thes One:] Ay-yo, man, are you real good at basketball?<br />
[Maanumental:] Uh… yeah, yeah…<br />
[Thes One:] Word? What else you good at, man?<br />
[Maanumental:] Ay-yo, I'll be eating pork rinds and stuff…yo, eat baby-back ribs… yo, just check it…<br />
<br />
[Maanumental:]<br />
Who else is gon' smoke menthol cigarettes<br />
And make the UPS uniform look fresh?<br />
Black is beautiful, yeah, that's the right word<br />
It'd be more bomb if it was blonde or bright <span class="grey-text">earned</span><br />
Say we lazy? Cut us some slack, aite?<br />
'Cause it's hard work trying to keep crack alive<br />
And plus we make the songs that y'all listen<br />
Burnt and scared, we all barbeque chicken<br />
Employed, most of grown men still rhymin'<br />
Tell you what shoes are cool and then shine 'em<br />
If you got it, we'll show you how to shake your ass<br />
And sit in the back of the class and not pass<br />
Make legit achievements &quot;straight wack&quot;<br />
Yo, you tryin' to rise up from the cracks? You ain't black!<br />
Where's your diamond in the back? Fronts in your tooth?<br />
The best athletes, we can run from the truth<br />
All the way home to apartments <span class="grey-text">we ran</span><br />
I got a big screen and pants with big <span class="grey-text">ramps</span><br />
Loyal to brass still ain't loyal to us<br />
So the whites pass, still at the back of the bus<br />
'Cause it's just too comfortable to stay chillin'<br />
Great scapegoats and make the best villains<br />
A planet without blacks ain't the right world<br />
'Cause somebody's gotta get at these white girls!<br />
<br />
[Newman:]<br />
Yo, I can't dance, can't jump so I can't dunk<br />
Like Eminem, hate rap 'cause I love punk<br />
Got a big truck, no fear when I say &quot;fuck!&quot;<br />
Drink beer, steer clear when I drive drunk<br />
Say &quot;fag&quot; when I bag on my buddies<br />
Wavin' a flag, then brag about money<br />
Four years of college and I never had to study<br />
Made the Dean's List 'cause he played gin rummy<br />
With mom and dad, think at the summer pad<br />
Be there in a minute, I got to get Brad<br />
We cruise for the chicks who look like they had<br />
A lot of work done and love Brooks &amp; Dunn, yeah!<br />
I'm votin' Bush again, set my VCR to tape the last Friends<br />
Love to tailgate, eat steaks and twins<br />
I rollerblade everyday, yes, all-American<br />
Big apple pie, &quot;one helluva guy&quot;, I keep my hair dyed<br />
But just on the tips, <span class="grey-text">built thin</span>, keep me ripped<br />
I'm on the Adkins, so I gotta skip chips<br />
Low on the car, but high on the hog<br />
Three in the fam, but I've got five cars<br />
Mr. Martinez just cut the front lawn<br />
His wife watched the kids while mom's at the bar<br />
<br />
[Thes One:]<br />
Okay, my friend, yeah, my friend, just nobody call INS again<br />
Mess around, lose all of your town's pedestrians<br />
Crosswalk walkin' with the babies in each hand<br />
Got a plan, buy a van, let the family grow<br />
And keep Calvin pissin' on something in the window<br />
We're downsized, we got the fly 80's hatchback<br />
Packed… Nike sticker on the back<br />
Painted in flat black with Pep Boy rims<br />
Fourteen smokes for fourteen folks<br />
Slim and fat, we can't fit, no joke<br />
But we'll make it to the beach, even if the Ford smokes<br />
Swimmin' around with cut-off cords and locs<br />
Jesus, Mary, Joseph in the boat<br />
They'd all look fly, and gold hanging on a rope<br />
Around my neck so low you catch the glow<br />
While I walk the block, yo, cop that vase<br />
Gimme the clock with Last Supper on the face<br />
Mechanical parrot that bends down to take drinks<br />
3-D Jesus on the cross that blinks<br />
Gotta spend the money from workin' that ass off<br />
And takin' all of the jobs Americans pass off<br />
And last off, I'd like to say it's all about <span class="grey-text">a-me</span><br />
So next time, catch me in line at DMV!<br />
<br />
[Chikara:]<br />
I'm a ninja! My <span class="grey-text">rear injure</span><br />
Everyday, sushi for dinner<br />
Fish, which is my favorite dish<br />
No soy sauce? You might get dissed<br />
I'm rich, I bought all your land<br />
Tourist time, digicam<br />
Disneyland, I'll be there<br />
<span class="grey-text">Limited dunks</span>, dyed my hair<br />
Yellow, bow with the &quot;hello&quot;<br />
Get a bad grade? Hell no!<br />
Chain smoke a pack a day<br />
It might be bad, but how you say?<br />
I'm rich, roll with the cool<br />
Karaoke, Asahi brew<br />
Miso soup in the business suit<br />
You might see me, I can't see you<br />
<br />
[Chikara:] Yeah… people don't even know how dope Japan is… it's even fresher than raw fish! You know what I'm saying? And I'm as dope as Japan is. My name is Chikaramanga from GP, yo. I'm out…<br />
<br />
[Sung sample:] Red, yellow, black or white<br />
[Sung sample:] I'm very kooky…<br />
