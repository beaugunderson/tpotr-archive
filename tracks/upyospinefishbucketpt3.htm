<h1>Up Yo Spine (Fishbucket Pt. 3)</h1>
<p><strong>Written by: Michael Turner &amp; Christopher Portugal</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>[Blewfoot:] What's happening, everybody? This is Blewfoots, coming out of East New York, Brooklyn, and uh… I'm with Thes One and uh, Double K, and they gonna be doing their thing at the Fishbucket… these cats been all over the motherfucking world… they been to Madrid, Spain… they been to Austria, the Netherlands, and they been to Africa, and doing they thing, so I want you to welcome People Under The Stairs<br />
<br />
[Thes One:]<br />
Yeah, get that girl, play this joint<br />
Bona fide, certified, make it my point<br />
Life of the party, lampshade on the head<br />
We anoint the dead, the flashlight give 'em life<br />
My quote, the zygote, the wife gets the action<br />
This funky mother like Katherine Jackson<br />
And me and him, Tito and Jermaine<br />
Been here for a minute, and we still got a name<br />
Well, that's cool, so how's school? I heard you got a pad<br />
I seen it on MySpace, thanks for the add<br />
House party with the funk, people, I'mma put it on ya<br />
Thes love beer like Garfield love lasagna<br />
The Monster's a dance that the chollos do<br />
Two fist in the front while you hold your brew<br />
And lean back, no more war, brown and black<br />
Homicide, let peace preside, L.A. get live like this<br />
<br />
[Both:] Up your spine, around your neck<br />
Woo-pah! We got the house in check<br />
Up your spine, around your neck<br />
Woo-pah! We got the house in check<br />
Ay-yo, we did it to them, and we gon' do it to you<br />
[Thes One:] Yo, Double K ([Double K:] Huh ha!)<br />
What's the name of your crew?<br />
[Double K:] Too sweet, too fresh, P-U-the-T-S<br />
[Thes One:] And where you from?<br />
[Double K:] L.A.<br />
[Thes One:] And we rock it the best<br />
<br />
[Double K:]<br />
We the backstage jollies, mini-bar smashers<br />
Super rhyme-makers, refresh like Shasta<br />
Jerome and Morris, we stomp for the <span class="grey-text">chorus</span><br />
To bring the walls down like Aerosmith<br />
One time for the present, and Thes shoot the gift<br />
We on stage like two hyped twins on the double<br />
<span class="grey-text">Sleep like Dos</span> Company ([Thes One:] Yeah, Larry and Jack)<br />
Barry White's the producer, Isaac Hayes wrote the rap<br />
We cut records at a high rate, put it on tape<br />
Test it on stage, then we go and cut the dub plate<br />
Now we on the Larry King Show ([Thes One:] Talking it up)<br />
An interview with Warren G, now we (Chopping it up)<br />
See, the people wanna know how the rep gets bigger<br />
Six albums and standing, now, y'all go figure<br />
We studio rap packing, jive rapping<br />
We Fun DMC… camera… action<br />
<br />
[Both:] Up your spine, around your neck<br />
Woo-pah! We got the house in check<br />
Up your spine, around your neck<br />
Woo-pah! We got the house in check<br />
[Double K:] Ay-yo, we did it to them, and we gon' do it to you<br />
Yo, Thes One ([Thes One:] Huh ha!)<br />
What's the name of your crew?<br />
[Thes One:] It's the P to the U, big T to the S<br />
[Double K:] And where you from?<br />
[Thes One:] L.A.<br />
[Double K:] And we rock it the best<br />
<br />
[Rap sample:] <span class="grey-text">The worker</span> from L.A., we work our butt off<br />
[Rap sample:] I don't like dissing nobody, I party too much<br />
<br />
[Thes One:] So if you got a problem with that<br />
[Double K:] Well, look, man… you shouldn't be our opening act!<br />
<br />
[Thes One:]<br />
We came here to drink beer, act dumb and get paid<br />
Fly back, get laid, make tunes to get played by you<br />
Because you like the funky stuff<br />
The P MP3s make the iPod buff and hard<br />
Like time on the yard and <span class="grey-text">gem clops</span><br />
Sharpen up the toothbrush, it's time to set it off<br />
The DJ set stabs the party in the neck<br />
It's a wrap, Double on my left, girls in his lap, like that<br />
[Double K:] We gonna party like it's 1969<br />
Smash the turntables, drink all the wine<br />
Pass out, wake up in '73<br />
And I still got these same two chicks with me<br />
Flash up for the future of the funk, and what you get?<br />
Two undeniable gentlemen who just don't quit<br />
We rock like arena, your local crowd pleasers<br />
We be backstage, heading on tour with the visa ([Thes One:] Yeah!)<br />
<br />
[Both:] Up your spine, around your neck<br />
Up your spine, around your neck<br />
[Blewfoot:] Give a big round of applause for these brothers right now… People Under The Stairs! C'mon now!<br />
[Both:] Up your spine, around your neck<br />
Up your spine, around your neck<br />
<br />
[Thes One, whispering:] Up your spine, around your neck (repeats)<br />
[Double K:] Look here, sweeper… I want you to sweep these MCs off this stage in 15 minutes. I'll be back in 10, and all of 'em better be gone, or I'll be up your spine and around your neck! In 15 minutes… Goodbye, sweeper…<br />
<br />
([Double K:] Get it in check, freak!)<br />
[Blewfoot:] I don't know… See, they didn't understand, see… I was on stage… with the People Under The Stairs…([Double K:] Right.) my motherfuckers (Yeah.)…</p>
