<h1>The Tamburo 5 (feat. Naimad, Assault, &amp; Shine 5)</h1>
<p><strong>Written by: Michael Turner, Christopher Portugal, D. Walker, K. Witcher &amp; C. Anderson</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>[Spoken sample:] &quot;…be chancing with all them foreign loc's around?&quot;<br />
&quot;Huh huh huh huh huh… I think not! They wouldn't dare to expose me!&quot;<br />
<br />
[Naimad:]<br />
For the niggas who's listening, I want y'all to pay attention<br />
As I start dissing wack MCs, on a BG mission for the fools who's missing<br />
UDC is the coalition, the Undisputed Champs<br />
Who smoke beedis and lamp<br />
These niggas taking this hip-hop deal as a joke<br />
Talking about freestyles that they wrote and never did a show<br />
All the talk is how many hos they hit, and <span class="grey-text">who man</span> weed they hit<br />
This shit gotta quit! Back in '86, it was the shit<br />
Brothas breakin' at Venice Beach, looking for tips<br />
Ain't that a bitch? Moms want me in the house by 6<br />
Say &quot;what's up&quot; to Thes, hooking up beats that's fresh<br />
And all those niggas in the P.U.T. to the S.<br />
Coming from the West, rocking this shit 'til there ain't nothing left<br />
<br />
[Spoken sample:] &quot;…And don't forget <span class="grey-text">Jersey</span>…&quot;<br />
<br />
[Assault:]<br />
No right hand on green in this here game of Twister<br />
On the next go around, best to pass this mister<br />
It's your worst nightmare, mad hand in all the other indicators<br />
By my need, I'm no herbal stimulator<br />
Cave your chest in like <span class="grey-text">abbots</span> know my method<br />
Those who question me, <span class="grey-text">it's</span> who I am, not impressed in their direction<br />
Or bros <span class="grey-text">harmed</span> and trapped with low visibility 'cause your thoughts unravel<br />
But my thoughts stay raveled to keep my words appropriate<br />
Too bad how much you indulge don't match with how dope you get<br />
I hope you quit pondering if this shit was just a trend<br />
Niggas I swore wouldn't go there, went off the deep end<br />
I'm peeping, they like… (does he still respect?)<br />
I drop the fat dimes that fuck up your mind, so check me…<br />
<br />
[Shine 5:]<br />
Not knew it <span class="grey-text">reversed, he</span> cover grimy, greasy<br />
Like to the speakeasy or to the bourbon at the bar<br />
Diamond smile on their star, her set-up man in the whip<br />
Flashing a sign, catching the bartender with a poison dart tip (Bing!)<br />
Which would finger to a lift, I replace it with my soul<br />
I reach deep into my soul as room becomes a BLACK HOLE!<br />
I'd shine like fresh polish, my protection<br />
Surrounded by anti-gods with no reflection<br />
The invisible one speaks: &quot;You ain't tough!&quot;<br />
Be moving wrong, swift kicks to his followers<br />
I asked, &quot;WHERE'S MY FATHER!?&quot;, someone drops a feather<br />
Shots hot like tempura belt me out my low sweater<br />
Lighting flash over me, stands like Dahmer (with the heater…)<br />
Another good soul lost in the quest for Tambura!!<br />
<br />
[Spoken sample:] &quot;You must… you must be losing your touch, <span class="grey-text">Jersey</span>&quot;<br />
<br />
[Double K:]<br />
Some niggas in this rap game be pissing me off (why?)<br />
'Cause they be swearing on their moms that they be coming off hard<br />
Yo, you ain't coming off shit, besides that shit you on<br />
Bitches got you thinking you bad just 'cause you made a little song<br />
Take a hit from the bong, boys, check out the gong boys<br />
Take a look at the crowd, that's why your moms ain't proud<br />
Yo, your work ain't appealing 'cause it's your cap I'm peeling to the dirt<br />
Fuck around and get your feelings hurt<br />
I'm going out for the kill, fool, you know what's the deal<br />
That's why your gay-ass crew is chilling with that look on their grill<br />
Like &quot;he a bully&quot;, but man, you just a pussy with mixed emotions<br />
About rapping, sell your CDs and take a tapping…<br />
<br />
[Thes One:]<br />
For the rhyme pilot, pulling niggas to the violent portal<br />
Existing in states that's not mortal or your average, not savage<br />
The Incan thinker, process I see, drop a line for your spine like Kung Fu<br />
See, I make it dense, got rhymes like Section 8 applicants<br />
Therefore, the crew out the house, kids when we rock mics<br />
Domination since days of Playboy hats and black types<br />
10-4, Thes rock, sock it to you with Spanish soul<br />
A quarter-inch cable stab through your boneskull<br />
Paralyzed in the middle of your fake pimp-walk<br />
(Yo!) Him shall catch, but him to talk <span class="grey-text">hops</span><br />
Scotch in a glass filled with methylated nitrogen<br />
Upon suggestion, endorphins turn to heroin<br />
You're lost and loving life, feeling so no pain<br />
P.U.T.S. beat you down with b.p.m.'s to the brain<br />
[Spoken sample:] Mask of Tambura… Mask of Tambura…</p>
