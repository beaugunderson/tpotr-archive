<h1>The Grind (Ste. For Peter Pt. 2)</h1>
<p><strong>Written by: Michael Turner &amp; Christopher Portugal</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>[Spoken sample:] Look, man, we gotta think about this together. We gotta take our time, and you and me are gonna come up with something. We're gonna figure out how to get this money. We have to press these records. We need the money, okay? Let's think about this. We'll work as a team, and we'll come up with something, alright? Let's work on it!<br />
<br />
[Double K:] (Ha!)<br />
Never flipped keys, might've sold an eighth or a dime<br />
I grind and hustle, it always involved the rhyme<br />
Travelling, dealing with different zones of time<br />
Done work equal hard play, we pay dues and shine<br />
Hit the studio… whoops! I gotta feed my dog<br />
Truncate the funky loop, and Thes says he'd gotta call<br />
And retail's waiting, so no time for chasing a spotlight<br />
Gotta call it an early night, gotta make sure this product's right<br />
The label's set a deadline, now we on the go<br />
The agency got a show, wake up<br />
We catch wreck, keep the sound correct<br />
Lay down the vocals and the levels are next<br />
This is what it's like in the world of a b-boy maniac<br />
Do the world tour: car, plane and Amtrak<br />
I ain't a business, man, but I'm the businessman<br />
Working like an entrepenuer with the wealth all planned<br />
Never had my hand out, don't nobody owe me<br />
But promoters and record labels still give me and the homie<br />
What we came here for (word)<br />
Or in the meantime, we'll have somebody at your door…<br />
<br />
[Double K:] Ay-yo… ay-yo, what's up, man. Yo, it's been a few weeks, you ain't returned our calls or nothing, so you know, we just came to check this out, man… I mean, where's the money at, you know? You see my hand out? And I ain't leaving 'til my hand's back in my pocket, you dig?<br />
<br />
[Both:] In the meantime, I gotta earn one<br />
We gotta earn one, man, in the meantime<br />
I said we work hard, in the meantime<br />
And in the meantime, man, I gotta earn one<br />
I gotta earn one, in the meantime<br />
So in the meantime, yeah, we work hard<br />
Ay-yo, we work hard, in the meantime<br />
([Double K:] In the meantime, man, I gotta earn one)<br />
<br />
[Thes One:] (Yeah, yeah, yeah…)<br />
You know, we stay on the go, and gotta see things progressing<br />
And work hard, like a man from the Depression<br />
Picking the pennies in any job, I think I gotta<br />
For the satisfaction, the action, the earned dollar<br />
You gotta understand, that's why we floss when we spend a lot<br />
Busting our backs in the studio like Tupac<br />
And like Pac, we got bossed by our label<br />
But it doesn't matter, the hard work is spinning on your turntable<br />
So many hours, man, you wouldn't believe<br />
Hanging up the hat and the coat, we rolling up the sleeves<br />
Getting hot, thinking the clock is breathing down my neck<br />
There's not enough hours, but so many things to do yet<br />
Gotta catch a jet at eleven, pacific time<br />
But it's crossing the Date Line, and we'll be in Sydney by nine<br />
The idle time on the plane's got me itching<br />
Hard work is the calamine, put the cook in the kitchen<br />
Man, let him stir it up, bring in the new flavor<br />
And fax the contracts with some business behavior<br />
Believe in the beats, the track record's been shown<br />
Fourteen years on the MPC gave me Carpal Tunnel Syndrome, man<br />
I'm still plans with my aching hands<br />
Staying up all night, making it funky for the fans<br />
If it doesn't earn, I know I'll get another turn<br />
'Cause we put in work like a Crip burning the sherm<br />
([Double K:] Hey, hom… what, hom?)<br />
It's the P, huh, it's the P, huh, it's the P for you<br />
It's the P, check it out…<br />
<br />
[Thes One:] In the meantime (yeah), we're gonna earn some (yeah)<br />
We're gonna earn some up in the meantime ([Double K:] Ooh yeah)<br />
We be the P, my brother, and yes we earn ours<br />
We gonna earn it up in the meantime<br />
And when we earn ours, we're gonna buy some nice cars<br />
And some yachts, and some houses<br />
And some dogs, and some dolphins<br />
And some homies…<br />
([Double K:] You can't understand it, man… <span class="grey-text">?...</span> You know what I mean… yeah, ha!)</p>
