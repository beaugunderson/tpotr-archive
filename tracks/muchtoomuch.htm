<h1>Much Too Much</h1>
<p><strong>Written by: Michael Turner &amp; Christopher Portugal</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>[Sung sample:] Stop! (Never too much, never too much, never too…)<br />
[Rap sample:] Stop!<br />
<br />
[Thes One:]<br />
Ay-yo, ha ha ha ha, it's just rap<br />
Too much beer, too much homeboys who all that<br />
Too many crates, too many breaks to chop<br />
Too much respect, too many years to stop this<br />
Too much hotness, too much accomplished<br />
Too much to still do and too much on my want list<br />
Too many things, too many hands to still shake<br />
Too many lands, too many plans to still make<br />
Too many obstacles on my way to give up to<br />
Too many personal standards to live up to<br />
Too many two or three <span class="grey-text">Henny shots</span> over the edge<br />
Too many of my fucking rap heroes are dead…<br />
Moment of silence<br />
Too much drugs, guns, gang-banging, and violence<br />
Too many dudes thinking they can bite Jay Dee<br />
Too many dudes want to rap and not MC<br />
Too too true, too much honesty, too much industry<br />
Who's who, too much Internet, too much YouTube<br />
Too many stages, too many roofs got raised<br />
Too many continents, too many currencies get saved<br />
Too much Double K and too much Thes One<br />
Too many long island ices and too much damn &quot;Fun!&quot;<br />
Too much music, too much of the funky stuff<br />
They say too much is too much, but bro, it's never enough<br />
<br />
I say &quot;All done…&quot;<br />
[Double K:] G-g-g-gimme some mo'<br />
[Thes One:] And I'mma keep drinking 'til I hit the floor<br />
[Both:] 'Cause one drunk monkey don't stop the show<br />
'Cause one drunk monkey don't stop the show<br />
[Thes One:] They said &quot;All done…&quot;<br />
[Double K:] G-g-g-gimme some mo'<br />
[Thes One:] And I'mma keep drinking 'til I hit the floor<br />
[Both:] 'Cause one drunk monkey don't stop the show<br />
'Cause one drunk monkey don't stop the show<br />
<br />
[Spoken sample:] And all that… (repeats)<br />
[Sung sample:] Stop! (Never too much, never too much, never too…)<br />
<br />
[Double K:]<br />
Oh! I just fell off the stage<br />
Tried to cripwalk to &quot;Acid Raindrops,&quot; had<br />
Too much booze with too much to lose<br />
You dudes act like you been watching too much Tom Cruise<br />
Too much waviness, too much laziness<br />
Party at the hotel, too much craziness<br />
Too much paid in this, too much made in this<br />
Lifestyle <span class="grey-text">plot</span>, got these boys thinking they thugs now<br />
I got too many bullets, they go &quot;Pow!&quot;<br />
Too much brawling, not enough hand claps<br />
I missed the early Nineties with too much sack<br />
And for some reason, all my heroes smoke too much crack<br />
Too many rich black folks not reaching back<br />
Too much to live for, rocked too many dance floors<br />
And too many people don't know what they in for<br />
With too much Obama and too much drama<br />
Too much of me not hearing New York rap<br />
But fuck that, we got too much funk<br />
Me and Dre smoke too many blunts<br />
Too much Patron, too much Hennessey<br />
And me getting drunk making enemies<br />
But I don't care too much for dudes and stuff<br />
It comes to that stuff, they say I do too much<br />
Too many bartenders, not knowing my fucking name<br />
In the hood, I'm double dutch, girls play too much<br />
<br />
[Thes One:] They say &quot;All done…&quot;<br />
[Double K:] G-g-g-gimme some mo'<br />
[Thes One:] And I'mma keep drinking 'til I hit the floor<br />
[Both:] 'Cause one drunk monkey don't stop the show<br />
'Cause one drunk monkey don't stop the show<br />
[Thes One:] They said &quot;All done…&quot;<br />
[Double K:] G-g-g-gimme some mo'<br />
[Thes One:] And I'mma keep drinking 'til I hit the floor<br />
[Both:] 'Cause one drunk monkey don't stop the show<br />
'Cause one drunk monkey don't stop the show<br />
[Thes One:] They say &quot;All done…&quot;<br />
[Double K:] G-g-g-gimme some mo'<br />
[Thes One:] And I'mma keep drinking 'til I hit the floor<br />
[Both:] 'Cause one drunk monkey don't stop the show<br />
'Cause one drunk monkey don't stop the show<br />
[Thes One:] They say &quot;All done…&quot;<br />
[Double K:] G-g-g-gimme some mo'<br />
[Thes One:] And I'mma keep drinking 'til I hit the floor<br />
[Both:] 'Cause one drunk monkey don't ([Rap sample:] Stop!) the show<br />
'Cause one drunk monkey (Stop! Stop!) this show<br />
[Double K:] Uh!<br />
<br />
[Spoken sample:] And all that… (repeats)<br />
[Rap sample:] Stop!<br />
[Sung sample:] Stop! (Never too much, never too much, never too…)<br />
[Spoken sample:] One!</p>
