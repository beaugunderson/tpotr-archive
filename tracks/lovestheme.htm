<h1>Love's Theme</h1>
<p><strong>Written by: Michael Turner &amp; Christopher Portugal</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>[Double K:] Yo, Thes One. Ay-yo, man, I think we need to take this time out… dedicate a joint to the ladies… you know, the ones that be in the front row reaching up, right? Woo… yeah, this one's for them, man. Kick it off to 'em…<br />
<br />
[Thes One:]<br />
To all the pretty young ladies, I'm so glad you're here<br />
You're so fly, you make me smile like child<br />
Like I'm too shy for introductions, a kiss on the hand<br />
([Double K:] Hello.) We posing with your friend<br />
And your cell phone cam, like &quot;did it flash?<br />
Did he spend cash, trying to win your heart? Like…<br />
Dinner and a movie at the ArcLight?&quot;<br />
Yeah, I got 'em pegged, some dudes are so predictable<br />
I bet he never told you how your toes are so lickable (Woo!)<br />
Some dudes like to hang around with dudes<br />
Play their PS2, burp, and watch YouTube<br />
But we should hit the town, walk around and look fresh<br />
Hon, you're so beautiful in your H&amp;M sun dress<br />
Caprese salad, pellegrini, California eating with the patio seating<br />
You deserve the world, and that's every lady ever<br />
As far as I'm concerned, every day you look better<br />
Natural beauty, all colors, shapes and sizes, I love it, my beloved<br />
And when the moment arises, a freak in the bedroom<br />
You lady's at the job, you the mother to a child<br />
Feel the comfort in the arms<br />
So you cannot know, and I suggest you get familiar<br />
I dedicate this to all the ladies, let me hear ya!<br />
<br />
[Both:] Eeny, meeny, miney, mo<br />
Catch that homegirl by her toe<br />
And if she hollers, let her go<br />
Pick it up, pick it up, pick it up<br />
Eeny, meeny, miney, mo<br />
Catch that homegirl by her toe<br />
And if she hollers, let her go<br />
Pick it up, pick it up, pick it up<br />
<br />
[Double K:] (This for Lisa, Laurie, Keesha, Maggie<br />
Karen, Jennifer, Tamika, Sharon, Syreeta, Sophie<br />
Kristen, Kimberly, Crowley, Wendy, Emily, Selma<br />
Quineisha, Erica, Esmerelda, Ashley, Maria, and Ceely)<br />
Now, this one's for our favorite fans<br />
In the front row smiling, watching the two jam<br />
Getting me distracted while I'm kicking my rhyme<br />
Afterwards, we can toast and maybe spend some time<br />
This an open invitation, when I'm on vacation<br />
I take 'em African , American, Indian, Haitian<br />
For the weekend, Mexican, Guatemalan<br />
The one's in Australia, yeah, man, they be whylin'<br />
And I love it when they got a job of they own<br />
In the bed, she's a freak, when it's time, she's grown<br />
And not a follower, she got her own agenda<br />
Didn't need me to make it, she might need me to break it<br />
Like: push, push in the bush<br />
I love the smell of they shampoo more than the kush<br />
I got the munchies for your love, so come and kick it<br />
I know you're tired of hearing that same ol' lame game<br />
On how his chain swinging, how the rap game changed<br />
But right now, my spotlight's on you<br />
Open up your blouse, baby, yeah, we did it for you<br />
And then we did for her, and then we did for you<br />
<br />
[Both:] Eeny, meeny, miney, mo<br />
Catch that homegirl by her toe<br />
And if she hollers, let her go<br />
Pick it up, pick it up, pick it up (c'mon!)<br />
Eeny, meeny, miney, mo<br />
Catch that homegirl by her toe (c'mon!)<br />
And if she hollers, let her go<br />
Pick it up, pick it up, pick it up<br />
<br />
[Both:]<br />
Girl, I love the things they know<br />
Love the things that they show<br />
I got to be where they go<br />
([Rap sample:] All the girl's out there!)<br />
Pretty girl, the sunshine in your hair<br />
The perfume anywhere<br />
The girls are everywhere<br />
([Rap sample:] All the girl's out there!)<br />
Girl, I love the things that they know<br />
I love the things they show<br />
I got to be where they go<br />
([Rap sample:] All the girl's out there!)<br />
Pretty girl, the sunshine in the hair<br />
And perfume anywhere<br />
The girls are everywhere<br />
([Rap sample:] All the girl's out there! You know it!)<br />
<br />
([Thes One:] Yeah, so the homie was telling me that he's watching a movie tomorrow night, that, uh, we could go out…)</p>
