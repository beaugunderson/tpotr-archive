<h1>The Ultimate 144</h1>
<p><strong>Written by: Michael Turner &amp; Christopher Portugal</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>[Thes One:]<br />
She would smoke [Mary Mary], the [Black Grass] sin<br />
[Amen Brother], a [Daisy Lady], [Indiscreet] with [The Funky Penguin]<br />
So [Get Me Back on Time], like Stella, I [Catch A Groove]<br />
This [Honky Tonk Women] said, &quot;Dude, [You'll Like it Too].&quot;<br />
So I [Boogie Back] 'cause the [Chella'lla] [Got to Be Real]<br />
[Apache] played, and we [Dance to the Drummer's Beat]<br />
When the [Bongo Rock], she stop, like, &quot;Thes, I'll [Give it to You].&quot;<br />
Your [Pussyfooter], [Different Strokes], [I Know You Got Soul]<br />
But I bounce when the breaks do, I had to [Sing Sing]<br />
[I'm Looking Out My Window], [Funky Music Is the Thing]<br />
See hip hop [Shifting Gears], it's [Hit Or Miss]<br />
Then again, there's no [Soul, Soul, Soul], just [Synthetic Substitution]<br />
My advice: [Get Up and Dance], choose [Heaven {or} Hell]<br />
Meet a belle, [Shack Up], and [Sing a Simple Song] well<br />
Anyways, haters had a [Cold Sweat] in [2001]<br />
[Son of {a} Scorpio] [Scratchin'] [Down on the Avenue]<br />
Like, yo, son, [I Like Funky Music], what a charade<br />
Egging me on like a damn [Easter Parade]<br />
[U.F.O.]-O-L party with the [Big Beat]s, a big liquid<br />
<span class="grey-text">Liquid fill with</span> [Long Red] <span class="grey-text">dawn</span><br />
We kick it for [Seven Minutes of {Funk}y President]<br />
And [S.W.A.T.] down [Planets] of themes like [Brother Green]<br />
For real, [It's Great to Be Here] and [Ain't We Funkin' Now]?<br />
Drunk and hungover in [Shangri La], ah, [Last Night Changed It All]<br />
[Impeach the President], yell, &quot;[God Made Me Funky]!<br />
Bush, you [Gotta Get Out of Here], take [Action] 'cause [Kool Is Back]!&quot;<br />
[Love's Theme] and [Granny's Funky Rolls Royce] was the Bar-Kays<br />
[Funky Drummer] made [The Champ] [Walk This Way]<br />
Like [Johnny the Fox], who stole [Ashley's Roachclip]<br />
A [Gangster Boogie] move, [Groove to Get Down] quick<br />
See, Ashley was [The {fly} Mexican], but [Keep Your Distance]<br />
A [Runaway {who'd always say} I Wouldn't Change a Thing]<br />
She loved my [Frisco Disco] [Phenomena Theme]<br />
Of a [Handclapping Song] was always [Sister Sanctified]<br />
I lied if I didn't think she'd give the [Willie Chase]<br />
But an [Uphill Peace of Mind] is not worth a busted face<br />
It's tragic like [Knock Him Out Sugar Ray], she'll [Blow Your Head]<br />
For a little [Change] and then call you [Mister Magic]<br />
Instead it's like [Star Wars] in the ghetto, like [Jack &amp; Diane]<br />
A [Bouncy Lady] who wouldn't be letting no [Rock Music] play<br />
While she worked [The Assembly Line]<br />
&quot;[I Walk On Gilded Splinters],&quot; she would say all of the time<br />
While Jack and his boy, [T Plays it Cool], did you puff?<br />
Used to [Think] they smoked [Space Dust], sure enough<br />
They would [Take the Money and Run], she wouldn't [Listen to Me]<br />
Man, [Lovermaniacs], [Yes We Can Can], but Jack was a [One Man Band]<br />
[N.T.] said, &quot;[Let a Woman Be a Woman, {and} a Man Be a Man]<br />
If I drank [Whiskey and Wines], so [Let's Have Some Fun]<br />
[Conga], smoke, [Yellow Sunshine], Jack, [It's Just Begun]&quot;<br />
He said, &quot;[I Believe in Music], we could [Ride Sally Ride]&quot;<br />
[{Getting} Lifted] in the [Rock Creek Park], they gotta hide<br />
A rookie pig caught 'em with the [Cookies], no [Misdemeanor]<br />
&quot;[Bring it Here], [Chicken Yellow], sunshine-fiender<br />
[Put the Music Where Your Mouth Is], [Sport]<br />
[Lonesome Cowboy] paying dues, saying &quot;[I'm Gonna Get You]!&quot;<br />
[Reach{ing} Out {in} Darkness] and he grabbed the punks<br />
Guilty now in the big [House of Rising Funk]<br />
Now, poor Diane got a [Hook &amp; Sling] to fill the commisary<br />
Letter said, &quot;I'm [Kissing My Love] to [Free Your Mind]&quot;<br />
Same cell block, other side, Ashley's [Papa Was Too]<br />
[Hector] hates [Devil{s} With the Bust] [Soul Pride] attitude<br />
Like a ride, just to [Cramp Your Style]<br />
Used to work a diamond mine [Shaft in Africa], wild dude<br />
Said, &quot;[I'm Gonna Love You Just a Little Bit More]<br />
You're mi [Corazon], I'd [Save the World] just to do [The Grunt]&quot;<br />
But Ashley's mom smoked [Dynamite {only} (The Bomb)]<br />
Who's watching [Films] since she had [The Breakdown]<br />
Calm, no [Country Cooking], young Ashley never felt [Joyous]<br />
So she packed her bags, yelled &quot;[Get Out of My Life Woman]!&quot;<br />
Ashley's mom cried, &quot;[You Don't Know How Much I Love You]!<br />
[Honey], [The Easiest Way to Fall] is to [Tramp]&quot;<br />
True indeed, but Ashley replied, tears in her eyes,<br />
&quot;I [Got What I Need], and [You Can't Love Me, If You Don't Respect Me]&quot;<br />
<span class="grey-text">Knew home missed</span> in [Expansions] of the [Blind Alley]<br />
<span class="grey-text">Told Cali to Fox</span>, &quot;She's too [Hard to Handle]<br />
[You and Love Are the Same], oh yeah, and Diane is my mom's name<br />
And it don't matter, [Don't Change Your Love]…<br />
<br />
([Party brother:] Drink some more… somebody, pour me some drink!<br />
[Party voices:] Keep it going (repeated)<br />
[Double K:] Where's my gun, nigga?<br />
[Bluefoot:] That's what I be talking 'bout! New Year's!<br />
[Double K:] Alright…<br />
[Party brother:] Got to have the funk… (repeated)<br />
[Party people:] We need the funk…<br />
[Double K:] What you need, man?<br />
[Party people:] Gotta have that funk<br />
We need the funk, gotta have that funk…)</p>
