<h1>Intro/4 Everybody</h1>
<p><strong>Written by: Michael Turner &amp; Christopher Portugal</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>[Mayor:] …Now, if I can at this moment, let me try to relate… to whatever questions you may have… Yes, sir?<br />
[Constituent:] Mayor, you spoke earlier about, like, the frustrations, uh… that black people, uh, have been going through and are going through… I'm frustrated to a point where, uh, I'm ready to give up on the system, but like I am a black youth, so can you… well, what would you tell me to do in terms of, like, whether following the system as it is… or going on off, and developing… inasmuch as I can, a new system…<br />
[Mayor:] Let me tell you as a brother…<br />
<br />
[Double K:] Look at me and my homeboy, we about to start a new system. My homeboy got a sampler, he loop-… Man, I got some tight-ass flows, nig- we gonna be bigger than Death Row, nigga, you got beats? Nigga, give me a call, we can make some money, nigga. Me and my homeboy, nigga, his sister rappin'. They call her Lady Lunatic, nigga! You need to get at me, homie. Nigga, I got flows, nigga…<br />
<br />
[Rap sample:] <span class="grey-text">(?)</span> Hip hop! <span class="grey-text">(?)</span><br />
[Thes One:] I can't stand this hip-hop shit nowadays. Word, I'm about to… ay-yo…<br />
[Double K:] One… Two… Shit, are we – Aight, dude… shut up…<br />
[&quot;Bobby&quot; (Double K):] Me and Mikey 'bout to get on the mic, represent… Nigga, ain't fuckin' around, you do it! Do it, Mikey, do it!<br />
<br />
[Double K:](Check this out, yo…)<br />
Yo, I want to see you dead in the worst way<br />
Ain't no way I'm 'bout to let you get down without a crown<br />
On the top of your dome, knowing you ain't &quot;rhyme&quot;<br />
You can't &quot;beats&quot;, they ain't hitting, spitting wack shit<br />
You better off quitting, homeboy, you ain't dope with this<br />
You got something else to say, fool, put up your fists<br />
Word up, I got more style than that nigga Prince had groups<br />
Beats be more slicker than them niggas in TROOP<br />
I ain't soup, don't even like that shit when I'm sick<br />
But I'm wit' it, hit it 'til your girl tell me to quit it<br />
But I don't and I won't, so please don't approach<br />
Catch your first-class ass-whipping from a nigga in coach<br />
The funk keeps spreading like AIDS in America<br />
I'm tearing you out your frame, ain't that a shame?<br />
Lame, that's what you is, treat you like your name was Liz Taylor<br />
Way to bring another round for the cheap-ass niggas<br />
Two brown-skinned figures with the need to rock, like crack<br />
And it's a fact that we here to smack characters on both cheeks<br />
If you plan to turn the other, uppercut your sister, knee-stomp your brother<br />
Double Trouble about to bring it to your body just once<br />
That's all that it take, until your ass yell &quot;rape!&quot;<br />
'Cause I'm doing it, doing it to your fucking ear-hole<br />
You better put me on <span class="grey-text">(?)</span>, sit back and watch your <span class="grey-text">fate fold</span><br />
'Cause me and the-s going places like tourists<br />
Purists, that's what we are, <span class="grey-text">leave a squad</span><br />
Better yet, make these motherfuckers run to the potty<br />
Huh, People Under The Stairs, bringing it for everybody<br />
<br />
[Thes One, Double K, <span class="grey-text">Smile-Oak, &amp; Assault</span>:]<br />
We got the beats and the rhymes and dimes (for everybody!)<br />
We create classic breaks from the crates (for everybody!)<br />
We come in with Horny Horns and the funk (for everybody!)<br />
We put in work to make the cuts you love (for everybody!)<br />
(loosely repeated)<br />
[Thes One:] Thes One puts in work to make the cuts you love…<br />
<br />
[Thes One:]<br />
It's a last, but never least, lever-released stock pattern<br />
<span class="grey-text">I cause motions, support motion, that's promotion<br />
Platinum make a madder commotion baker rise</span><br />
Rise up, my people, let's get <span class="grey-text">ready to the fed beat to me shoe</span><br />
In lieu of the fact, my tracks skip to my lou (nah, dude)<br />
I <span class="grey-text">(?)</span> in divine cosmos, absorb the beats through deep osmosis<br />
Thes is creator of this experience <span class="grey-text">which is</span><br />
I leave the life forms listless<br />
Witness, I request, fathom that,in SeaQuest<br />
<span class="grey-text">Get even persona in the (?) was deeper</span><br />
I put your Shure microphone in a sleeper<br />
Keeper of the funk and a format<br />
Discs, tapes, and more DATs<br />
Than a lake of straight cats and dogs<br />
<span class="grey-text">Kings fella</span> like Lincoln Logs<br />
Thes resemble pleasant peasant from Fertile Crescent<br />
American Inca <span class="grey-text">reared</span> with a beer and <span class="grey-text">an accent</span><br />
Essential, these credentials that read &quot;me, super MC,<br />
Spell it with a capital T-E-S <span class="grey-text">mostro plato que si</span><br />
I be fresh, put up your hands and wave 'em<br />
Yes, yes, y'all<br />
We on the ball like the Globetrotters<br />
I do this for your father and your mother<br />
Your parents <span class="grey-text">who's</span> apparently, inherently<br />
Talent you inherit, see, I am the result of super sperm<br />
In other jams or at the party<br />
The P is the body funking for everybody<br />
Corona for everybody<br />
Beedis and blunts and beers<br />
(for everybody!… for everybody!… etc.)<br />
<br />
[Thes One, Double K, <span class="grey-text">Smile-Oak, &amp; Assault</span>:]<br />
We got the beats and the rhymes and dimes (for everybody!)<br />
We create classic breaks from the crates (for everybody!)<br />
We come in with Horny Horns and the funk (for everybody!)<br />
We put in work to make the cuts you love (for everybody!)<br />
(loosely repeated)<br />
<br />
Buddy… [Double K:] Yo… beats and the rhymes… a couple of dimes… We create classic breaks from the crates with Horny Horns and funk… yeah… People Under The Stairs…We be funking like your <span class="grey-text">heart was stopping</span>… the studio funk… yeah… Thes One <span class="grey-text">(?)</span> in the place… Double Trouble… bring it all for you!</p>
