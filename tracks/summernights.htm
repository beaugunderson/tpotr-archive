<h1>Summer Nights <font size="1"><strong>(Kat O1O feat. People Under The Stairs)</strong></font></h1> 
<p><strong>Written by: Kat Mobley, Michael Turner &amp; Christopher Portugal</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>([Double K:] Yo, we on that Al B. Sure! tip... on that Ronnie, Bobby, Ricky and Mike tip...)<br />
[Thes One:] You look ([Double K:] fine)<br />
It's your (night)<br />
Drink this (wine)<br />
Let's get (right)<br />
Summertime state of mind<br />
Let yourself go<br />
Life is just a party<br />
[Both:] Everybody say (ho!)<br />
<br />
[Thes One:] You look ([Double K:] fine)<br />
It's your (night)<br />
Drink this (wine)<br />
Let's get (right)<br />
Summertime state of mind<br />
Let yourself go<br />
Life is just a party<br />
[Both:] Everybody say (yo!)<br />
<br />
[Double K:]<br />
Leaning back and the feeling's good<br />
Come catch a vibe like I know you should<br />
It's Double K and Thes One again<br />
With the summertime fun, sunshine you're seeing<br />
The ladies dressed up, drinks pouring up<br />
Security at the door, no signs throwing up<br />
So get your dance on, rub-a-dub, toast<br />
For the DJ spinning the jams with most ([Spoken sample:] Hey!)<br />
Request it... Wanna get live? I suggest it!<br />
Baby says she wanna dance, let's step, then<br />
Screw your 9-to-5 and your boss man<br />
Turn off the cell phone, let's get lost, and<br />
Freak 'til we cold turn it loose<br />
You can touch my face, I can fill your boots<br />
It's a wonderful feeling, when we hitting the ceiling, girl<br />
Get the climax, we can keep on dealing, 'cause...<br />
<br />
[Thes One:] You look ([Double K:] fine)<br />
It's your (night)<br />

[Both:] Everybody say (yo!)<br />
<br />
[Thes One:]<br />
You spend your whole day working out for some jerk<br />
The 9-to-5 is your life, but they pay you dirt, girl<br />
You wonder when will you ever get your turn<br />
They ask "Why you ask? Yo, I guess you will never learn", though<br />
The money will go, yes, the money will come<br />
Just as sure as the sun goes down tonight<br />
And tonight's the night to put down the fight, girl<br />
The party unfurls, it's like another world, me and you could "Sin-bad"<br />
Huh, I'm just kidding, have to <span class="grey-text">chunk on</span> with your dad, ha<br />
Your smile was the missing accessory, we live for this revelry<br />
We're young as we'll ever be<br />
<br />
[Thes One:] You look ([Double K:] fine)<br />
