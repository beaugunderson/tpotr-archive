<h1><em>...Or Stay Tuned</em> Section Introduction</h1>
<p><strong>Written by: Michael Turner &amp; Christopher Portugal</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>([Double K:] Yo, I j-… man, I just got some new slang today… it was up under the freeway and shit, and it was a sign that said &quot;Speed Humps&quot;… you know, &quot;Speed Bumps&quot;? But, I think &quot;Hump&quot; should mean… things suck like… shit, &quot;Humps&quot;…<br />
[Blewfoot:] What's wrong with you, man?<br />
[Thes One:] I'mma get you a Philly.)<br />
<br />
[Thes One:] Alright, album four: <em>…Or Stay Tuned</em>, People Under The Stairs, 2004. Came out on Om Records, and that's kinda like the hidden album to me. I mean, I don't know, we had… we had all this steam coming out of <em>&quot;O.S.T.&quot;</em>…<br />
[Double K:] Secret…<br />
[Thes One:] Secret, we had extra tracks and just weird stuff, and… you know, we were… we were trying to keep the momentum going, and it was hard because we were touring so much at that time, I mean…<br />
[Double K:] We couldn't even really go make an album, so it was, like, &quot;Let's bust out a few new tracks,&quot; which on that album, there's like four or six brand new tracks for that album that we made…<br />
[Thes One:] Right, and…<br />
[Double K:] Everything else is, like, throwaways from <em>&quot;O.S.T.&quot;</em>…<br />
[Thes One:] I wouldn't say &quot;throwaways&quot;, 'cause, I mean…<br />
[Double K:] Nah, nah, nah, nah… we just couldn't fit it on <em>&quot;O.S.T.&quot;</em>… they don't make 110-minute CDs, so…<br />
[Thes One:] Right… and you know, I…<br />
[Double K:] Who wants to put that album out?<br />
[Thes One:] After <em>&quot;O.S.T.&quot;</em>, you know, we had… we had immediately hit the road, pumpin' the album up. We went on tour with Del. We did our first US tour. Like, when I say &quot;US tour&quot;, I mean sixty cities &quot;US tour&quot;, all around…<br />
[Double K:] Yeah…<br />
[Thes One:] And it didn't stop…<br />
[Double K:] That was the Cali Com tour… Cali Com tour, yeah…<br />
[Thes One:] Cali Com, yeah… the homie Dre was with us and Alex, and we didn't stop, man…<br />
[Double K:] JazMak…<br />
[Thes One:] JazMak was there, and we just kept touring and touring, around the world: Japan, Australia, Europe, the US, Canada, like… we couldn't… we couldn't take a day off, we were touring so hard at that time.<br />
[Double K:] Word.<br />
[Thes One:] Anyway, bottom line is that record, man, there was a lot of… you know, even… even for what it was, though, we put a lot into that record, like… &quot;Yield&quot;? That track still rocks out live, you know… that's a big track for us still…<br />
[Double K:] We ain't kicked that off the set in years.<br />
[Thes One:] It's not coming off the set.<br />
[Double K:] Nah, nah.<br />
[Thes One:] &quot;Yield&quot;, the first track of <em>…Or Stay Tuned</em>, is staying on the set, so… you know, <em>…Or Stay Tuned</em>, 2004. That was the joint, right there.<br />
<br />
[Double K:] Yo, I see 2,000 party people in here right now.<br />
[Thes One:] Yeah, we sold out tonight!<br />
[Double K:] And I wanna hear 2,000 party people. How they sound, man?<br />
[Thes One:] I wanna hear one million party people.</p>
