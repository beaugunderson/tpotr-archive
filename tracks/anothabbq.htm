<h1>Anotha' (BBQ)</h1>
<p><strong>Written by: Michael Turner &amp; Christopher Portugal</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>[Blewfoot:] How 'bout that? Hold on, man, let me get some paper… I'm fucking tough... How much is that? Fifteen, that's twenty, and that's twenty-four…<br />
[Man #1:] That's all there is…<br />
[Blewfoot:] How's your ? Shit, where the party at?<br />
[Man #2:] What's up?<br />
[Man #3:] You got nothing!<br />
[Woman #1:] Hi!<br />
[Blewfoot:] Hey, y'all<br />
[Woman #1:] Hey, Mark!<br />
[Blewfoot:] Hey, y'all! How y'all doing? Hey, hey… Hey, you got some beautiful lime green pants on, man. Some pants… St. Nick... <br />
[Double K:] You gotta get some of this barbeque, man…<br />
[Blewfoot:] Come on, St. Nick… St. Nick… Nick…<br />
<br />
[Double K:]<br />
Woke up feeling good, so it's thanks I give<br />
I never been shot, and never did a bid<br />
So I reckon it's the right day, after Friday<br />
So I call up my homes (yeah, man, what you say?)<br />
I told him we about to have a barbeque (word)<br />
So pick up some ice and bring the chronic brew<br />
The home girl's down the street went to the swap meet<br />
To get some more chicks, they'll be back at three<br />
So we break out the bones and get to slapping 'em down<br />
We got &quot;Do Wah Diddy&quot;, pumping surround sound<br />
It's a lovely day, and I feel like Bill Withers<br />
Food stacked on the plate, man, lunch and dinner<br />
The neighborhood's chill as the sun goes down<br />
Niggas getting tipsy and begin to clown<br />
But we all just laughing, eating, cooling<br />
Giving high-fives, talking 'bout the old school<br />
And sending BGs to the store for blunts<br />
I dedicate this song to the first of the month<br />
We might wake up and try to do it again<br />
Yo, that's how it goes down, it's the city I'm in, so<br />
<br />
[Double K, with Thes One in the background:]<br />
You bring the beef, and I'll bring the brew…<br />
Oh shit, another barbeque<br />
You bring the links, and I'll bring the brew…<br />
Oh shit, another barbeque<br />
You bring the wings, and I'll bring the brew…<br />
Oh shit, another barbeque<br />
You bring the ladies, and I'll bring the brew…<br />
Oh shit, another barbeque<br />
<br />
[Thes One:]<br />
At my crib, I got three barbeques<br />
One I keep upstairs for daily use<br />
But downstairs, pumping out eighty thousand BTUs<br />
Don't get it confused, I'll bring the beef to you<br />
(Hey, hey, homie, don't touch my grill!) I got it under control<br />
Flip meat like I flip beats, cooked with soul<br />
Only use the best ingredients available<br />
That's my word, they're cooking turds over Kingsford<br />
Charcoal, but it ain't going out like that<br />
Tortillas and corn, and we can all get fat<br />
And if you want another plate, get you some more<br />
Hey, the dog'll eat whatever meat falls on the floor<br />
Empty-handed New Jacks back to the store, hit the shelf<br />
And don't bring back beer you wouldn't drink yourself<br />
Like putting Laser in the cooler, making the switch<br />
Then I see you drinking my Cooper's, son of a bitch!<br />
That's the oh-one-two, but homie, it's all good<br />
It's an L.A. thing, and that's understood<br />
It's the same old barbeque, but man, it's all good<br />
It's just an L.A. thing, and that's understood, so<br />
<br />
[Double K, with Thes One in the background:]<br />
You bring the beef, and I'll bring the brew…<br />
Oh shit, another barbeque<br />
You bring the links, and I'll bring the brew…<br />
Oh shit, another barbeque<br />
You bring the wings, and I'll bring the brew…<br />
Oh shit, another barbeque<br />
You bring the ladies, and I'll bring the brew…<br />
Oh shit, another barbeque<br />
<br />
[Double K:]<br />
Oh shit, another barbeque<br />
Oh shit, another barbeque<br />
Hey, why you always having so many barbeques, man? I mean, it's good and all, but… Aw shit… Sure, you gonna have another one tomorrow, right?... Next week… Week after that… What you gonna do, make a song about it or something?<br />
Barbeque… (repeats, ad libbed)<br />
([Thes One:] Yeahhhh!)<br />
Aw shit, another barbeque (scats)<br />
(Wooooooo!)<br />
<br />
[Blewfoot:] Well, me and my partners, man, we was over here at this park, over… right off of Dumont and Berriman, and we was playing basketball, right? All of a sudden, some niggas come in there and just start setting up their equipment, and they said, &quot;yeah&quot;… the niggas start jammin'… &quot;yeah, yeah, okay, cool, right on!&quot; Niggas set up their shit, having two turntables… and, uh, this black nigga with fingerwa- uh, I mean, with waves in his hair, 'cause we used to wear the waves, you know, with the brush… We used to brush our shit and put the Murray's grease in there? And then… he was rapping, man… but then, there went this other… this other rapper by the name of Super Slim, was coming over here… you know, like they was like robberies, and we was just standing there just watching them, and the niggas rapping, and he said, &quot;Yeah, Super Slim… you ain't shit, so get your dead ass outta here!&quot; And it was the funniest thing, man… Dude was just like… &quot;mm-hm!&quot; It was the funniest thing, man… They were just making up all kind of, fucking…<br />
[Double K:] Who's was th... Was that Doctor Love?<br />
[Blewfoot:] Brooklyn, East New York, yup… right on Dumont… right on Dumont Avenue and um… Berriman… yup, right there, man. This is like back in '75 and, uh… '76, about…</p>
