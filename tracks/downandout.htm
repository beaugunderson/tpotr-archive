<h1>Down And Out</h1>
<p><strong>Written by: Michael Turner &amp; Christopher Portugal</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>[Rap sample with whispered gibberish underneath:]<br />
You are now rocking with the best…<br />
Now I'm back and ready to get ill…<br />
<br />
[Whispered sample:] Superbad!<br />
<br />
[Double K:]<br />
Yo! I heard somebody said we wasn't West Coast<br />
Well, that's shit 'cause these lousy bastards never come close<br />
They judge books by covers, none of them are butter<br />
([Thes One:] What?) None of them can rap (Right!), all of them are crap<br />
I'm sick of speakin' the situation of everybody and their mom<br />
Wantin' to use hip-hop as an occupation, though<br />
You should give it up and quit talking shit, come to us<br />
Get some beats, and let us show you this… 'cause see…<br />
Y'all be fronting when your songs is bunting<br />
And ours be home-running, fireworks and all, man<br />
We too hardcore to get caught up with that shit<br />
That's right next door, so we stay far from gossip<br />
Don't wanna hear nothing about what this hip-hop guy said<br />
About what some bitch said about us being rude at her party<br />
Man, just buy our latest shit, sit back, and chill<br />
And if not, go and purchase something ill<br />
'Cause the P ain't rapping for no head wraps and vegetarians<br />
That get no respect… ([Thes One:] Crazy!)<br />
I'm representing concrete streets and beats, grass, rocking them ass<br />
And drinking flammables out of shot glass, that's real to me<br />
And it's too real for you, maybe a little Shania Twain, some Celine Dion<br />
You know, fireplace kissing on a date for all you pee-on,<br />
You soap-opera, fake-tag, watch-wearing, no-rapping… stupid…<br />
I don't even know what the fuck I want say to your dumb ass!<br />
([Thes One:] Walkin' around sellin' your tapes and shit!)<br />
([Double K:] Bitch… beat it!)<br />
<br />
[PUTS sample:] The-s going places like tourists<br />
Purists, that's what we are…<br />
<br />
[Thes One:]<br />
Yo! We was in a record store the other day, me, Double K<br />
And Brother Paul, I heard this dude saying<br />
Our 12&quot; didn't belong on the wall, that we didn't represent L.A.<br />
He's straight-faced with a gold medallion and a fat Pele Pele, I laughed<br />
Our style's not the radio play, yeah, we rip it<br />
But most follow the trends of friends and they skip it<br />
No image, no backpack, headphones, or head wraps<br />
No reverse racism ([Double K:] Take that shit back, black!)<br />
You're darker than me, but far from an authority<br />
And even farther from the struggle, that's why they call you bourgeois<br />
Now, hip-hop's in the house, ay-yo, it's time for your rehearsal<br />
Dressed up in fatigues, you sap Gap commercial, stop stressing<br />
Go hang your collection of repressings, P dig for beats everyday<br />
That's pure essence, moving lessons as a street level entrepreneur<br />
Black and Latino, a two-man operation, fo' sho'<br />
I make the beats, he does the scratching, and we both write the rhymes<br />
Engineer and do the artwork and release it on time to distribution<br />
So no confusion that means we do it all for the fans<br />
Think I'm lying? Check my SoundScan<br />
([Double K:] Ay-yo, I always do my part)<br />
And I do mine for the artform of hip-hop, I love it and live it<br />
And can't stop, this is true underground with the mass appeal of soul<br />
People Under The Stairs, no cliché, rock and roll, it goes…<br />
<br />
[PUTS sample:] The-s going places like tourists<br />
Purists, that's what we are…<br />
<br />
[Thes One:] So if you been around, you know the sound<br />
And what we believe<br />
If you're tired of that fake shit, than this is what you need<br />
Trying to take it back to '92 and make the people shout<br />
But the P will always be down and out<br />
[Double K:] Ay, don't take it as we dissing or we trying to be tough<br />
We just calling nigga's bluffs and hopefully now they shut up<br />
And let us handle what we handling, this didn't work?<br />
Yo, we beatin' up jerks, you know?<br />
<br />
[Double K:] Comin' around here, man? We can't deal with you anymore… Keep that shit up and it's over, alright?… We gone, gonna let you listen to the rest of the song. My man, Thes One, I'm Double K, and we the P. For '9-9 and on, punk, you know? My nigga, Thes One. And Cap'n Kidd Lexus is definitely inside of the heezy-zee!<br />
<br />
[Scratched sample:] Oh! Don't want…<br />
[Whispered sample:] Superbad!<br />
[James Brown sample:] It's the way I feel!<br />
<br />[Sung sample:] Oh! Don't want no woman<br />
Telling me how to live my life…<br />
Don't want no woman<br />
Telling me how to live my… oh, I…}</p>
