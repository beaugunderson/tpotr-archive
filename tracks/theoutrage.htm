<h1>The Outrage</h1> 
<p><strong>Written by: Michael Turner &amp; Christopher Portugal</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>[Thes One:] P… It's that Los Angeles life, c'mon… <span class="grey-text">see a show… it's not… eh, I don't know, man… not dope… guys</span>… talk a lot of doo-doo on the internet about… make it out to the streets once and a while…<br />
<br />
[Thes One:]<br />
The two-track electrical, medical <span class="grey-text">meadow-made</span><br />
Minimum beat played, freshly made each day<br />
With hands in the crates like kids on cookie plates<br />
The rookies wait, but I won't retire 'til I'm eight tracks<br />
Leaving the tape recorded like Watergate<br />
On the map, like a thumbtack to navigate<br />
High-stakes, I delegate rap to elevate<br />
Delicate my debates with celibate beat tapes<br />
They don't touch, I crush the crutch of personas<br />
Same players in the game claiming that their owners<br />
I'm not picked, my life's my music I make on my trip<br />
Something sensitive for the youth like My Dog Skip<br />
And not a Little Bow Wow, I rock the rap pow-wow<br />
Kids know the now, they follow me like the Dow<br />
<span class="grey-text">Over piper-pied</span>, making a musical drive-by<br />
On I-5, I slide by, giving a high-five to tie-dyed hippies<br />
<span class="grey-text">Trippy pen-tricks</span>, when I write my class, it's the shit that hits<br />
Don't ask, it's none of your business, how I do it<br />
I send a sound wave <span class="grey-text">forward</span>, you pursue it<br />
I knew it when I threw it out, it's moving it through in the cloud<br />
Rocking the crowd, making 'em <span class="grey-text">proud</span>, playing it loud<br />
Slaying the wild beast, not from the East<br />
It's from the West on the beach where I perm and smoke sherm<br />
So take your turn to jock, I walk my block and talk<br />
To local shop owners about 'Pac and whether or not he's dead<br />
Quickly a critic catch a bullet to the head, pull it, you're dead<br />
Looking into the light, go ahead, don't walk back<br />
'Cause if you walk back, I'm cocked back<br />
The black senator strap, and give the trigger a tap<br />
And you'll be hanging out with Biggie, Jesus, or Roger from Zapp<br />
Take that! Lay flat and lay low or catch a halo<br />
While I move on to another song to collect my peso<br />
Fresh and not clean, in between the bell curve bottom and the mean<br />
I mean, People Under The Stairs, heard not seen, fiend!<br />
<br />
([Thes One:] What's it like?)<br />
<br />
[Both:] It's like an outrage when punks step on stage<br />
With the weak show, weak flow, you still get dough<br />
You ain't as dope as you thought, not as nice as you claim<br />
Get ready for your downfall, it's only a game<br />
It's like an outrage when you step on stage<br />
With that weak show, weak flow, and still get dough<br />
You ain't as dope as you thought, you not as nice as you claim<br />
Get ready for your downfall, it's only a game<br />
It's like an outrage when the punks step on stage<br />
With the weak show, weak flow, but still get dough<br />
You ain't as dope as you thought, not as nice as you claim<br />
Get ready for your downfall, it's only a game<br />
<br />
[Double K:]<br />
Yo, we be flowing against dudes, going against rules<br />
If you thinking we came to lose, sucka, I got news<br />
It's the P's examiner, cock and then hammer ya<br />
Better run, get protection, the lesson we teach<br />
Something you can't preach, well, just listen<br />
It's hip hop backed by a couple of young guns<br />
You thinking we talking shit, homie be having fun<br />
Because we been here for a minute, setting it off<br />
Just killing you soft, for a small price, it's nice<br />
About fifteen for the LP, add the tax<br />
You see us on stage and we giving it back<br />
One hundred and forty-nine, plus ten percent<br />
For my peoples in the crowd with the Js on lit<br />
And we the shit you can't flush, sit there and deal with it<br />
We come too real with it, you say we ill with it<br />
So, why would anybody want to do that? (Hey, do what?)<br />
Diss the P and say the jam was wack<br />
I'mma tell you niggas why y'all talk too much<br />
Ain't getting no attention, so you steady downing us<br />
But we checking y'all like moms and homework<br />
(Forgot to put your name on top) Watch the beat drop<br />
Like my caddy when I finally get one, I'm on two<br />
Fuck a backpack, big words, man, fuck you!<br />
I heard you tryin' to funk, like, &quot;These niggas is drunk!&quot;<br />
They take theyself too serious (man!), making me furious (man!)<br />
But not enough to start acting (nope!)<br />
Like I'm Larry Fishburne, I sit back and smoke herb<br />
I'm coming in, covered deep, and I got my piece under the seat<br />
For any Oliver mark-ass t'Wang<br />
Call up the homie O-Dub, said &quot;It's time to bring pain!&quot;<br />
Better get started on that farewell e-mail<br />
Tell 'em Double K and Thes One shall prevail<br />
It's the Old School Testament, ready to strike back<br />
To the dugout, so we can party all night<br />
&quot;Slow down, Double K!&quot; is what the people say<br />
I reply &quot;What? I can't!&quot; 'cause I'm a champ<br />
Like stepping to the Rap-<span class="grey-text">girl's</span> Delight<br />
Make it sunny at night with fresh beats that's tight<br />
Beats that sound right, everything y'all like<br />
People Under The influence, stealing your bike, punk!<br />
<br />
[Rapped sample:] Rhyme <span class="grey-text">while we get us an end?</span><br />
[Rapped sample:] Guess what, y'all?<br />
