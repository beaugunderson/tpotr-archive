<h1>Yehaw Partystyles</h1>
<p><strong>Written by: Michael Turner &amp; Christopher Portugal</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>[Thes One:] (Where's my 40 at?)<br />
You see me, and on the mic, we be digging through the crate<br />
Pull a rock out, d-doop doop, 'til the heads shake<br />
And when I rock out with an empty 40 bottle<br />
My brain's moving like a train, rolling at full throttle<br />
Got a thought that'll drop, and cipher punks scatter<br />
Shatter windows and turn bystanders to anti-matter<br />
See these flows a lot of the time, <span class="grey-text">cuts mind</span>, remove grime<br />
Make an inner-city mind, shines like a new diamond<br />
If I find 'em drinking booze and they're not ready<br />
I'm cutting with the force of a Norse jungle machete<br />
Rejuvenating the funk as I <span class="grey-text">greet it</span> through your city<br />
Stealing your papa's records and chilling with my inner-city<br />
Committee of B-Boys, MCs, and DJs who keep the anti-skate on three<br />
Drink fours, smoke trees, hate fives<br />
&quot;Pass the Peas!&quot; like they used to say<br />
See our shit sounds something like they used to play<br />
It's in my blood, how could I change from back in the day<br />
You must be deranged to tell me that we're strange 'cause we strayed<br />
From the sound of every record up on the wall with what we give 'em<br />
Compromise a beat with DJs with no rhythm<br />
That's not how I'm living, see, I elevate art<br />
The head shaker get you high, see, we do our part<br />
Before I go, I wanna say &quot;peace to PA&quot; and &quot;Dolla' bill, y'all&quot;<br />
I'm out, I got a 40 on chill…<br />
<br />
[Thes One:] It's like that, y'all, so get drunk tonight<br />
It's like that, y'all, so start a fight tonight<br />
It's like that, y'all, get a number to write tonight<br />
Clock the nigga over there, man…<br />
[Double K:] And get high tonight<br />
It's like that, y'all, get drunk tonight<br />
It's like that, y'all, start a fight tonight<br />
It's like that, y'all, get a number to write tonight, and<br />
[Sung sample:] Keep on standing, brotha!<br />
<br />
[Double K:]<br />
It goes one time for the pager, two times for the callback<br />
Three times for the sack, and I'mma start it like that<br />
For the dudes with these millennium raps and punchlines<br />
I'm back with a foul mouth, delivering good rhymes<br />
<span class="grey-text">Like take a</span> one-two, Scooby Doo and the crew<br />
Wanna drink some brew (Man, who is this dude?)<br />
The La Cienega Strangler, stalker<br />
Always staring at somebody's daughter, posting with the…<br />
([Thes One:] Yo, man, you need to chill out with that…)<br />
Alright, I'm only bugging, like to get 'em drunk off Cisco<br />
I'm not from San Fran, but I can tear up the disco<br />
The nigga under the liquor store, lamping without a doubt<br />
On point like a Boy Scout, Rest In Peace to Roger Troutman<br />
&quot;I'm chilling like a villain,&quot; that's the answer to how I'm doing<br />
And living, giving, and also selling beat downs for chumps and punks<br />
Even my friends is trying to make some ends<br />
And hang out with Friendly Fred, so we can Do It To Death<br />
The P jacked your last breath on some old…<br />
([Double K:] Man, everytime you come around here [shut up, old man!]<br />
You got this shit all loud and shit and all of your goddamn…)<br />
Just tell your peoples I'm here, tell 'em run in fear<br />
Tell 'em hide their beer, I'm about to make a new year<br />
And call it 1-9-9-DJ Kaos<br />
The boss of the second level, yo, you just got tossed<br />
Take that, you little bitch, get some T-K-O<br />
The <span class="grey-text">pro of</span> kinda-dumb niggas, and I'm dead you know<br />
<br />
[Both:] It's like that, y'all<br />
And get drunk tonight<br />
It's like that, y'all ([Thes One:] Little brother!)<br />
[Both:] Start a fight tonight<br />
It's like that, y'all<br />
[Double K:] Get a number to write tonight<br />
[Both:] It's like that, y'all ([Thes One:] Do it, do it, do it, do it, do it)<br />
[Double K:] And get high tonight<br />
[Both:] It's like that, y'all<br />
So get drunk tonight<br />
It's like that, y'all ([Thes One:] What!?)<br />
[Double K:] Beat a nigga ass tonight<br />
[Both:] It's like that, y'all<br />
[Double K:] Get a number to write tonight<br />
Let's get high, alright?<br />
([Thes One:] It's like that, y'all, it's like that, y'all… and we out)<br />
<br />
[Rap sample:] I rhyme the way, there ain't no shame in our game<br />
[Spoken sample:] Head to the bar, copped me a 40<br />
[Spoken Sample:] Do it!<br />
[Rap sample:] I rhyme the way, there ain't no shame in our game<br />
[Spoken sample:] Got kinda high and kinda drunk<br />
[Spoken Sample:] Do it!<br />
[Rap sample:] I rhyme the way, there ain't no shame in our game<br />
[Spoken sample:] <span class="grey-text">The wife</span> kicked the ass of this little punk<br />
[Spoken Sample:] Do it!<br />
<br />
[Rap sample:] I rhyme the way, there ain't no shame in our game<br />
[Spoken Sample:] Do it! (scratched and repeated)</p>
