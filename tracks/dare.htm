<h1>D.A.R.E.</h1>
<p><strong>Written by: Michael Turner &amp; Christopher Portugal</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>[Domino's operator (Double K):] Br-r-r-r-r-r-r! Hello, welcome to Domino's Pizzeria… May I take your order?<br />
[Double K:] Yeah, let me get a spliff-lover's pizza, topped with some mushrooms<br />
[Domino's operator:] Okay, mushrooms. Will that be it?<br />
[Double K:] Uh…put a lot of shrooms on it.<br />
[Domino's operator:] Alright, so extra mushrooms.<br />
[Double K:] A lot of shrooms.<br />
[Domino's operator:] Sir! Are you faded or what!<br />
<br />
[Double K:]<br />
Yo, when I awaken, the first thing on my mind<br />
A little bit of cornflakes and a blunt that's all mine. (HA!)<br />
I'm stingy as fuck with the herbs that I hold<br />
Unless it's my brothers from the crew, we all blowed<br />
'Cause every day, every hour, no matter what I'm into<br />
Somebody pull out three, I pull out one, I got love<br />
We can get one for four, so let's go to the spot where <span class="grey-text">cheeba's</span> at<br />
Yo, how we gonna toke, my bong's broke, let's get a Philly loc<br />
And pass the smoke, choke only if it's mixed with all the drama<br />
Amateurs stay away, don't wanna have to call your mama<br />
'Cause it's time to handle busy-ness<br />
([Thes One:] Time to handle dizziness)<br />
Ay-yo, pass the OJ, so I can stop feeling this<br />
Damn, I should've stuck with the batch of happy hip, I wouldn't trip<br />
I could take about 10 to the lip and won't slip<br />
Plenty of drugs I've had. From mixing spliffs to droppin' tabs<br />
Yo, I'd do it again at the right time and right place<br />
Thes is fucking with the X, but I don't like the taste<br />
Yo, let's get <span class="grey-text">an eighth</span> of psilocybin<br />
Wash it down with some Donald Duck.<br />
[Thes One:] Yo, let's do this. Yo, Q. Are you gonna chew it? Or are you gotta swallow it?<br />
[Double K:] Everybody agrees. We all chilling, aight? About half an hour later, we all illing.<br />
[Thes One:] Want some orange juice to follow it?<br />
<br />
[Thes One:] Now, let's sit back and take this ride to the next<br />
Level and dimension, not to mention, you'll feel better<br />
Here, stay warm, put on a sweater, and we'll float<br />
Imagine in your mind, me and you on a boat<br />
Floating through the seas, taking E in the sun<br />
Positivity emanates, have some, enough for everyone<br />
See, they riding on our boat, from the beat, I cope with stress<br />
See, I let it go, you let go, too, and we'll let go of the anchor<br />
Float back to your favorite memories and bank a<br />
Left at your childhood then make a U-turn<br />
Look forward with one hand over your eyes like a captain<br />
Lookin' off the stern, just off into the sound waves, off of the bow<br />
An island on the horizon appears right now with a speaker on it<br />
See, I'm a speaker in it 'cause my sound's infinite<br />
Broadcasting live from a positive vibe, five channels of your sea radio<br />
(What?) So, yo, just say &quot;no&quot; like you learned in fifth-grade<br />
And watch me and Double K straight fade into the speakers<br />
<br />
[Double K:] So, just say &quot;no&quot; like you learned in fifth-grade<br />
And watch me and Thes cold fade into the speaker<br />
[Thes One:] So just say &quot;no&quot; like you learned in fifth-grade<br />
And watch me and Double K straight fade into your speakers<br />
<br />
[Double K:] So just say &quot;no&quot; like you learned in fifth-grade<br />
And watch me and Double K fade into the speakers<br />
[Thes One:] So just say &quot;no&quot; like you learned in fifth-grade<br />
And watch me and Double K straight fade into the speakers<br />
<br />
[Double K:] Ay-yo, just say &quot;no&quot; like you learned in fifth-grade<br />
And watch me and Thes cold fade into the speakers<br />
[Thes One:] <span class="grey-text">President</span>, c'mon, just say &quot;no&quot; like you learned in fifth-grade<br />
And watch me and Double K straight fade into the speakers<br />
<br />
[Double K:] Ay-yo, just say &quot;yes&quot;...<br />
[Thes One:] C'mon, listen to Nancy Reagan for once, buddy!<br />
[Double K:] ...Hit this shit, fool!<br />
<br />
[Spoken sample:] That's right, it's just that we're going to the country…<br />
<br />
[Spoken sample:] It took us two million years to get out of the drink…<br />
(repeat)<br />
…<span class="grey-text">in the brochure</span>, it'd take another two million to get back in!<br />
[Spoken sample:] &quot;Go ahead, go ahead, make some <span class="grey-text">piece out for a</span> People Under The Stairs album.&quot; &quot;Roll that ish, light that... and smoke it!&quot; &quot;What do you think about smoking?&quot; &quot;I had some for the first time with my dad and my godfather&quot; &quot;Hey, man, why you got no shoes on?&quot; &quot;Ha ha, I don't need it!&quot;</p>
