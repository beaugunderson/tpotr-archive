<h1>California (feat. Blvme)</h1>
<p><strong>Written by: Michael Turner, Christopher Portugal &amp; B. Barnes</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>[Sung sample:] California, California, California<br />
California (keep it rock-), California (keep it rock-)<br />
Cali- (keep it-), Cali- (keep it-), California (keep it rockin')<br />
<br />
[Double K:]<br />
Hey, right across the border from Mexico<br />
It's a place where all the fly people go<br />
Sand, dog near the beach, where fantastic times<br />
Is never out of reach, home of the Chong and Cheech<br />
You can pack it, you can roll it up the I-5<br />
Bonfire and Corona, give your man a high five<br />
Home of the Three's Company, we trey time chilling<br />
Birthplace of the Willie Calhoun, we got the best shrooms<br />
Don't miss the contributions we gave the world, 'cuz<br />
Chicanos and low riders, Dodger Blue<br />
You know we got our own thing, created our own slang<br />
God bless Earl Stevens, we only got one season<br />
And we call that ([Rap sample:] Fun!), we made rappers (run!)<br />
We made it hella cool to be hard and pack guns<br />
We turning out countries one at a time<br />
Better believe we got the world in <span class="grey-text">our</span> state of crime<br />
With them Hollyqood squares and silicone models<br />
Silk shorts, rolled cigar, and a Playboy grotto<br />
So if you need glamour and fame, wanna change your name?<br />
Here the donor, come and get this game, this is…<br />
<br />
[Both:] The Golden State ([Sung sample:] California)<br />
It's the P, you know we represent CA (California)<br />
And I just had to let you know that we all call (California)<br />
Our home, we spit that Cali homegrown (California)<br />
Yeah, we known<br />
<br />
[Thes One:] Ay-yo, Blvme, come in here, man, get on the mic (California)<br />
Gotta let 'em know…<br />
[Double K:] Sunshine (echoes)<br />
<br />
[Blvme:]<br />
Yo, one for the Thes, and two for the Ks<br />
Three for Walker Martin 'cause we run L.A.<br />
Yeah, what's cooking up the stairs, .22, .28?<br />
If you didn't make the barbeques, then you aren't from the state<br />
Mighta caught 'em hanging loose with peace, me in the Bay<br />
And pretty ladies love the P, ghetto serenade, oh<br />
And I'm from Mid-City, they call me the Blvme<br />
<span class="grey-text">PS anthem bank the uno</span>, we Kool and the Gang<br />
You already know the repertoire, might get dissed<br />
Like others already did, and may they rest in piss<br />
'Cause it's West Coast-ra nostra, my holster's hot<br />
Homo, we gon' smoke a dub, and Bullies on the Block<br />
Yeah, we Los Angelinos with SoCal soul<br />
<span class="grey-text">These forgy nickels</span> gotta give the people out in the roll<br />
The end of the 110 South, trying to find the hideout<br />
But Crescent Heights security is here to put your lights out<br />
(Boom!) We eat beat scavengers for breakfast<br />
You fooling with the union we got <span class="grey-text">ful(b-r-r-r)rexis</span><br />
So hang up the slip mats, two producers is back<br />
With blunts and six-packs, enjoy the fucking tracks…<br />
([Double K:] …we did, kid! Ha ha)<br />
<br />
([Sung sample:] California)<br />
It's the P, you know we represent CA (California)<br />
And I just had to let you know that we all call (California)<br />
Our home, we spit that Cali homegrown (California)<br />
Yeah, you know ([Double K:] Punk!)<br />
<br />
[Double K:] Ay-yo, Thes, man… I know how you get down… come and run it down, one time, all the way down the 5 for us… right!<br />
<br />
[Thes One:] (You know it)<br />
Nifty since 1850, compare what Thes set up shop<br />
Like Junipero Sera: on a mission, fresh fish in the tortillas<br />
The clean, healthy living, home of the ideas<br />
That changed the world, like Apple and Atari ([Double K:] Yup!)<br />
Surf, skate, and snowboard, Hollywood stars be side-by-side<br />
And lane change with gang-bangers on the 15<br />
National parks and rangers<br />
Be keeping it clean up on the John Muir path<br />
Fresno, John Steinbeck, Grapes of Wrath<br />
In the Central Valley of Cali where they produce produce<br />
That's why, worldwide, we got juice<br />
We gave 'em cool jazz and that gangster rap<br />
And that hyphy life be better when you on the map's left side<br />
West side of the USA, pride, never hate, on the Golden State<br />
We get live in the blue state, you're welcome here<br />
It's an endless summer, barbeques and beer<br />
From Steamer Lane down to tressles up to Lake Tahoe<br />
Spring suits, baby, we the dime patrol, it goes…<br />
<br />
([Sung sample:] California)<br />
[Double K:] Ay-yo, yo, you know we come from L.A., but we gotta give it out… we gotta give some shouts to Sactown, Oaktown, <span class="grey-text">Merced, yeah,</span> everybody in the Bay, Vallejo, Indio down here in the desert, down there by the Diego, Santa Cruz, Anaheim, everybody living it up in Malibu, out there to Pomona to I.E., motherfuckers hiking in Yosemite, skiing in Big Bear, you know where we at. The I-5's so live. The I-5's so live. Yo, give the I-5 a high five. Ah ha ha. Aw yeah. Know we stay ready. Doo do do doo. Live on… clap on, children… play on, brother… fly on, sister… woo!<br />

[Big OG Rick:] So, I was walking down the street, so I see this girl just go to <span class="grey-text">high school</span>. I used to love that motherfucker, she was fine then a motherfucker… ([Double K:] What was her name?) oh, god… what was this girl name? Donna… her name was Donna… (Donna.)
