<h1>The Trip</h1>
<p><strong>Written by: Michael Turner, Christopher Portugal &amp; Andre Satchel</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>[JazMak:] (Uh… haah…)<br />
Now, normally on tour, it's hella easy to score<br />
Especially when we just need us a little bag of weed<br />
Just to last us through the night and get some more the next day<br />
(But the country of Japan) saw that shit another way<br />
Damn two hundred U.S. bucks for the price of a dime?<br />
Get the hell up out my face, yo, that's committing a crime!<br />
(And now the trip is worth its while) a pair of legs and a smile<br />
Oh, and did I mention that I met her at this club, we saw Quentin<br />
(<span class="grey-text">Didn't</span> 'bout my stage status) and my hotel room<br />
Not knowing <span class="grey-text">that must</span> be the place where I trip on some 'shrooms<br />
You know, they legal in Japan?<br />
([Double K:] Ay-yo, 'Dre, man, you lying!)<br />
I think the theme of Tokyo is based on motherfuckers frying<br />
(Ay-yo, Shibuya is the spot) for the mushroom shops<br />
About a quarter of an ounce is what me and her got<br />
(Ay-yo, we ate the whole thing!) That's what had a nigga tripping<br />
Dancing barefoot in the hallway, feeling just like a hippie<br />
(Tie-dye everywhere I look) man, I'm feeling so great<br />
Bugging off the walls, TV shows, and even my date<br />
(She was even ill and feeling backed up the corner)<br />
Leave it to my crazy ass to throw a glass of water on her (Ahhh!)<br />
(Is it ever gonna stop?) this shit is lasting all night<br />
The trip <span class="grey-text">all</span> went from good to bad when I loc up on Mike<br />
After eight or nine hours, my high finally came down<br />
Don't even smoke cigarettes, but a pack got <span class="grey-text">clowna</span><br />
<br />
[Double K:]<br />
It's a solution with no problem, man, I'm feeling great<br />
Laying next to pretty skins, let the sins begin<br />
I'm cooling and relaxing, and I slowly slow down<br />
Thinking 'bout what I just did, kinda feeling like a kid<br />
Illing with no end, now I hear the noise<br />
But I'm bailing and zoning out, heard nothing but a shout (Ah!)<br />
From my boys in the next room, always hard<br />
No time for laughing, man, I'm in the devil's play-yard<br />
Wishing I was at school, but I'm posted in Tokyo<br />
Trying to get the feeling, yo, trying to smoke a Philly, yo<br />
Pacing back and forth in the hallway had me tripping<br />
Up and down by the grace of a rope, I'm on dope<br />
Hey, y'all remember that arcade (Yeah!)<br />
Thought I heard Ken, <span class="grey-text">Guile</span>, and Zangief having beef<br />
Yo, I was spooked like a modern-day American<br />
In a third-world ghost town (Shh!) Didn't make a sound<br />
Word up, it's gotta stop, I need to cop some reality<br />
Put in a cup, hit it like I shoulda been doing… screwing up!<br />
Hey, man, was this some opium or what?<br />
<br />
[Thes One:]<br />
Sitting in my room, door locked, stomach burning<br />
The portable playing &quot;Light My Fire&quot;, and it keeps turning<br />
I'm concerned and all being in a foreign land<br />
And not even speaking the language, sitting here in Japan<br />
Starting to trip, the record skips, didn't even notice<br />
I'm sitting on my bed, <span class="grey-text">a tribe</span> tried to keep my focus<br />
Hocus-pocus things disappear, things in my ear, saying<br />
&quot;Remember what you said on 'Ten Tough Guys'? Well, listen here:<br />
You were right, give up the fight, it's all a dream<br />
Now, you're understanding things in this world aren't what they seem<br />
Merely a scheme, convince yourself that you're a human being<br />
Though you see 'em, the others are being paid per diem by your mind<br />
And find yourself a healthy person, you don't question it<br />
The effortless etiquette gets success, man, imagine it:<br />
A <span class="grey-text">big skit</span>, a tisket, a tasket<br />
Your ass kicked the bucket ten minutes ago, so now you know the truth be told<br />
It's all invisible, you made it, hate it or you love it<br />
But fuck it, you're above it, now, you ended it, it's over&quot;<br />
Now I'm sober, can't wake up, &quot;Too bad, you're doing so well<br />
In the life you made up, it's all over…&quot;<br />
<br />
[Thes One:] It's all over… it's all over, dude… it's all over…<br />
[Double K:] Hey, word. Thes… Ay-yo, let's see what's up with this <span class="grey-text">groove</span>, man…<br />
[Thes One:] What'd I get s-<br />
[Double K:] Nah, you stay right there. I mean, what's up… Ay-yo, Thes… yo…<br />
[Thes One:] Man… the fuck?…<br />
[Double K:] Man, you need to call home or something, man, you cool?<br />
[Thes One:] Uh… uh, Mike? Mike? Mike, Mike!<br />
[Double K:] Ay-yo, man, <em>save a buck or two! Save a buck or two! Save a buck or two!</em><br />
[Thes One:] What's up, Mike?<br />
[Double K:] Hey, what's happening, man? You alright? Here, man, let's open up this window and shit, man. Yeah, man, just let this shit play, man. 'S all cool, man. Yeah, just chill out, man, you need to-<em>save a buck or two!</em> Yeah, 'cause I'm tripping too, man, but everything's cool, man, you know… You got 'em outside, man, he's right there waiting for you, man…<br />
[Sung sample:] Man, we couldn't be much higher… (repeats)<br />
[Double K:] Yeah… stay right there, young buddy… Did great… <em>Save a buck or two!</em>…</p>
