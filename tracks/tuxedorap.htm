<h1>Tuxedo Rap</h1>
<p><strong>Written by: Michael Turner &amp; Christopher Portugal</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>[Double K:] Tuxedo rap, hand clap, party people…<br />
[Sung sample:] Woo!<br />
<br />
([Double K:] Whip it, whip it, whip it!<br />
Get it, get it, get it!<br />
Whip it, whip it, whip it!<br />
Just get it, get it, get it!<br />
<br />
[Double K:] (Yeah, yeah…)<br />
Hey, man, we the ones who rock on the rhythm<br />
We tearing the roof off, it's the one that we give 'em<br />
Deliver the freshness, so you can go get it<br />
Get with it, everybody, let's up-jump the break beats<br />
Spinning like platters, we rock on precisely<br />
Accurate jam timing, hot for the kids<br />
West-bounding on the track, you know just what it is<br />
See the name on the marquee, we 'bout to get biz<br />
Get the girls, after-party, back at the crib<br />
We pouring up the liquors, it's time to have kids<br />
I'm the fresh cut maker, fly beat creator<br />
Corner-of-the-block-hanger, professional player-hater<br />
Getting the job finished, we leave them with a smile<br />
They say, &quot;You make it funky!&quot;, been doing it all the while<br />
Bass-lines with the left-hand scratch<br />
Back-spin the vinyl breaks we catch ([Sung sample:] Woo!)<br />
[Thes One:] The, The People Under the Stairs, they rock it fo' (sho')<br />
Afro-Latin rap styled, kids be letting 'em ([Double K:] know)<br />
Los Angeles duo, hip the hop, good to (go)<br />
You know my bro, smoking blunts on the (patio)<br />
Now, dig it, listening to the crew number (one)<br />
Who turned on the sex machine, let it (run)<br />
Shine to the rhythm, west to east like (sun)<br />
So have fun, Jimmy Castor we just (begun)<br />
Blow out your lungs, hung jury, jaywalk (free)<br />
Limo-tint MC's, people envy the (P)<br />
Telescope-dope star power (definitely)<br />
Me and the homie, Christmas Michael light up the (tree)<br />
He, he roll it like Dogtown Z and the (Boys)<br />
Heavy D, Blue Funk, P is bringing the (noise)<br />
Graceful poise while toys, no soul, gold-fishing like kois<br />
We commission the Michelin, retire and roll (boy)<br />
The-s one, Double K, pop the bubbly, party rock<br />
Dub'll be center the festivity, 1984, your activity<br />
L.A. Kings are back, so come on, get with me<br />
([Sung sample:] Woo!)<br />
<br />
[Double K:] Whip it, whip it, whip it, soul sister!<br />
([Spoken sample:] Oy!) ([Spoken sample:] C'mon!)<br />
Just get it, get it, get it, soul sister!<br />
([Spoken sample:] Oy!) (x2)<br />
<br />
[Double K:] (Huh huh huh huh!) ([Sung sample:] Woo!)<br />
I was out on a mission, hanging at night<br />
Smoking some cheeba-cheeba and ran into a fight<br />
Two young brothas and one got dissed<br />
I broke up the fight and it sounded like this:<br />
I said, &quot;There's only one champ, everybody have fun.&quot;<br />
One brotha said, &quot;Split!&quot;, I pulled out my gun<br />
&quot;No need to act tough, ain't no need to boast&quot;<br />
I said, &quot;I'm just the party rocka from coast to coast&quot;<br />
And everybody started rapping, everybody started clapping<br />
The young man shook my hand<br />
He said, &quot;I didn't wanna fight, not making a scene<br />
It's just [Both:] I ain't got no bread, I'm wearing some old threads&quot;<br />
[Double K:] And in the nick of a time, I sported a fresh rhyme<br />
And at the flick of a J, he was wearing some new vines<br />
I said, &quot;Look, little brotha, quit fussing a mess<br />
Try to rhyme like me, and soon, you'll be fresh ([Sung sample:] Woo!)<br />
[Thes One:] He said, &quot;I'm Under the Stairs, not the ladder and chutes<br />
I keep 'em Faze-O high like Bootsy boots<br />
Tight with the loops like Windsor knot<br />
I'm the rap rooty-toot, all up in your thoughts<br />
Girl, it may take money and may take time<br />
But you will never find another MC with my rhyme<br />
And if you do, that's cool, you just send him my way<br />
And if the sucka say to Double K, he wrote it yesterday<br />
Then he's a lying cheat, a thief and a bum<br />
A hip-hopping lowlife, trying to live in the slums<br />
But the real rap came here to act young<br />
Handclap party people say ,&quot;Cheers!&quot; and have fun<br />
Just throw up your hands from side to side<br />
And let the P vibe make you feel real live<br />
Just throw up your hands from side to side<br />
And let me know your alright, tonight ([Sung sample:] Woo!)<br />
We high five with the…<br />
<br />
[Double K:] Whip it, whip it, whip it, soul sister!<br />
([Spoken sample:] Oy!) ([Spoken sample:] C'mon!)<br />
Just get it, get it, get it, soul sister!<br />
([Spoken sample:] Oy!) (x2)<br />
<br />
[Double K:] It's the next (next) step (back) in the form of a sound<br />
Party people, make room when we come to your town<br />
[Thes One:] It's the number one sound, hottest thing around<br />
Tuxedo rap, handclap for the people, Howie T<br />
[Howie T sample:] Howie T's in the back with the rap to tap<br />
Into the bassline add it to the 8-track<br />
[Both:] Huh! So take that, Howie T and the P<br />
We settle the score, you need more? And that's what we here for!<br />
<br />
Whip it, whip it, whip it!<br />
Just get it, get it, get it! (repeated)<br />
<br />
[Spoken sample:] Whip it on 'em!<br />
One time! (repeated and scratched)<br />
[Double K:] Huh huh huh huh!<br />
[Spoken sample:] Whip it on 'em!<br />
<br />
[Spoken sample:]<br />
[Florida:] Now, you work all day and then you take an extra job working all night… oh, James, I'm sorry…<br />
[James, Sr.:] Baby, you say you sorry one more time, I'mma give you something to be sorry about in here!… And take your hats off in my house!<br />
<br />
[Spoken sample:] That's what be going on sometimes, you know… to a lot of folks it ain't been funny, you know why? 'Cause the dude they with ain't laugh 'cause they had to pay that money… yeah! <span class="grey-text">(?) Dig it? That's going come out wears these overalls…</span></p>
