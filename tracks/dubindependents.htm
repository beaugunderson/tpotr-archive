<h1>Dub Independents <font size="1" color="#aaaaaa"><strong>(unofficial title)</strong></font></h1> 
<p><strong>Written by: Michael Turner &amp; Christopher Portugal</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>[Thes One:] Y'all got me in a bad mood, man.<br />
[Shawn Jackson:] Aww, shit, what's good wit' it, man?<br />
[Sung sample:] Today!<br />
[Shawn Jackson:] Why don't you do it, man?<br />
[Double K:] <span class="grey-text">Lord Chiefnuts!</span><br />
[Thes One:] I-I gotta get this off my chest. See, there's a lot that you don't know…<br />
[Shawn Jackson:] Let 'em know!<br />
[Thes One:] …as a music fan, as the consumer out there.<br />
[Double K:] BO!<br />
[Thes One:] There's a lot behind the scenes that you don't know.<br />
[Shawn Jackson:] Uh huh, uh huh, uh huh<br />
[Sung sample:] I said today!<br />
[Double K:] <span class="grey-text">I'll let the little person</span> rap!<br />
[Thes One:] I'm pulling the curtain back from the wizard…<br />
[Shawn Jackson:] Yeah, get 'em!<br />
[Thes One:] Check this out…<br />
[Shawn Jackson:] You got it, Thes, get 'em!<br />
<br />
[Thes One:] ([Sung sample:] Today!)<br />
Today, I lay it on the line, set the record straight<br />
Eye-level, Fourth Amendment, I don't care if labels hate ([Double K:] Uh!)<br />
You see it's two thousand e-eight, the industry's a sham<br />
And I ain't gonna play a game, just so y'all can steal some grams (Uh!)<br />
I do it for the fans, the legacy of rap<br />
For the tears that was shed, for the children who got capped<br />
For every MC that never had a chance or got a break<br />
Pushing on the glass ceiling, I can feel the fucker break<br />
[Sung sample:] I know when I'll reach, I will write you, yeah!<br />
[Thes One:] Industry glass ceiling<br />
I can feel the motherfucker starting to crack<br />
Saying selling the crack is a prerequisite to rap<br />
Now, I've sat across the table, and I've seen the press files<br />
Where they make up back-stories of moving weight to Ohio<br />
([Double K:] Say it! Say it! Say it! Say it!)<br />
And the magazines… the magazines, man, they buy it<br />
Putting fake facts on the racks so that you'll buy it<br />
What it all boils down to, in case you never knew it<br />
The whole music industry thinks you're fuckin' stupid<br />
You are just a dollar sign, marketing demographic<br />
The effect on the art form of rap has been tragic<br />
And I speak in first-hand 'cause I've seen an old man<br />
Tell a young up-and-comer with the mic inside his hand<br />
What to say so they'll play his new song on TRL<br />
Dre puttin' Rakim on hold, his lyrics wouldn't sell<br />
But <span class="grey-text">I have fiend</span>, I mean, behind the scenes<br />
The puppeteers, they think they're winning<br />
They ignore the People Under The Stairs, a new beginning<br />
Anti-industry, Fun DMC, September 30, we bring the party<br />
It's Double K and me, independently, we work the angle like my angel<br />
([Sung sample:] My angel, babe<br />
[Double K:] Ease up, Thes One!)<br />
[Thes One:] My angel, Michael Turner<br />
Christopher, the second comforter<br />
People Under The Stairs, Fun DMC with the murder (Ha!)<br />
Ten-year anniversary and never had a tour bus<br />
Roll up to the venue in a Chevy, it's just us (Ha!)<br />
We took ourselves on 21 world tours for the fans<br />
'Cause they bought 100,000+ units and demand<br />
A little more in the stores, but you still don't see no features<br />
'Cause we can't afford to advertise, and they don't know the readers (Fun DMC!)<br />
Need to know that we know there's a war goin' on<br />
For your dollars and your thoughts, motherfuck a CEO<br />
I ain't helping them buy no yachts (Ha!), I don't make it rain<br />
1999, no one was feeling us, we jumped up on a plane<br />
Traveled Europe on a train, doing shows alone and sweatin'<br />
From the gear we had to carry…<br />
Three years later, we was playing Glastonbury<br />
Essentials, Redding, Leeds, came and rocked Field Day<br />
Festivals around the world, and now you say<br />
&quot;Well, they never played the festivals here!&quot;<br />
It's because they never asked and we was busy drinkin' beer<br />
Makin' rap music, funky rhythms and rhymes<br />
Fun DMC for ten years, we ain't changing for the times<br />
We're making rap music…<br />
Fuck the &quot;Four Elements&quot;, fuck the slogans<br />
Yo, fuck a street cred, fuck the fancy press posing<br />
Fuck Clear Channel, Universal, Warner Brothers, Capitol<br />
We jumpin' in the rental, take this shit national<br />
We faithful, we stay independent and true to it<br />
Whatever music that you like, stay true to it<br />
'Nuff respect to big picture on September 30<br />
Raise up your middle finger when you buy Fun DMC! (Fun DMC!)<br />
A small step, but we taking shit back<br />
We keep a torch alive for that independent rap<br />
Just a small step, but we take some shit back<br />
We keep the torch alive, it's that independent rap music<br />
<br />
[Comel:](Yo, yo, chill!) Yo, yo, Thes, y-<br />
(Yo, yo, chill!) What you cleaning your guns for, man.<br />
(Chill out! Chill out!) Yo, it ain't worth it, you got a family!<br />
(Slow down, man.)<br />
[Double K:] Yo, Fun DMC, September 30th<br />
[Comel:] Just keep it-keep it- keep it in the studio, man.<br />
[Jaysonic:] Yo, man, fuck this, man. Let's throw on some danceable shit, man.<br />
[Comel:] Keep it in the studio. Play that record, man. Calm down! Put the guns away!<br />
[Jaysonic:] Depressing me!</p>
