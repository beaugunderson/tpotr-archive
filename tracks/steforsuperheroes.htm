<h1>Ste. For Superheroes</h1> 
<p><strong>Written by: Michael Turner &amp; Christopher Portugal</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>[Sung sample:] Watching TV (the American shows)<br />
Watching TV (with those superheroes) (x2)<br />
<br />
I wanna travel the eons of time<br />
Speed through the cosmos at warp factor nine (x4)<br />
<br />
[Spoken sample:] Look at the jam on the mic! "It's a bird! It's a plane!"<br />
<br />
[Double K:]<br />
In the sky, tripping, o'er this life I have been given, yo<br />
Ring the bell, delusional, devoted to the usual<br />
Flying through the air, no care, debonair<br />
Me and my posse under the stairs, so don't stare<br />
Killin' 'em, a bad look, Facebook status<br />
Climbin' the apparatus, <span class="grey-text">you can mad bawl at us</span><br />
We show you who the baddest, the rap rhyme's tragic<br />
Abraca-dab, nanu nanu, my nig<br />
Landed at your girl's crib, and let me tell you what we did<br />
I took off my hydropowered illuminator<br />
Spit a rhyme so super that I knew it would hit her later<br />
Gargled the Budweiser, jumped off the riser<br />
Defeat the undefeated, I'm the thrilla, chump... beat it!<br />
Sign in the sky, now I gotta go<br />
Gotta beat up the foes, gotta change outta clothes<br />
These swords are syllables, these clones, we killin' those<br />
Herb the kryptonite, the Bop Gun blast right<br />
"Pew pew pew!", hah hah!<br />
<br />
[Spoken sample:] Up, up and away! Pssshhhhh...<br />
([Spoken sample:] Whoops!)<br />
[Sung sample:] I wanna travel the eons of time<br />
Speed through the cosmos at warp factor nine (x4)<br />
[Rap sample:] He was super quick, super slick<br />
Always <span class="grey-text">using the fly kick</span><br />
I can fly like a bird in the sky<br />
<br />
[Thes One:]<br />
Is it a bird or plane? Up in the sky, it's insane<br />
It's super, the super, the superrappin', what is his name?<br />
It's Thes One, schooled in the trade of a boom bap<br />
The controller of microphones, I make the stadium clap<br />
I suppose I'm predisposed with the prose, suckas go toe-to-toe<br />
My freestyle is rodeo, exposing them Glass Joes over past flows<br />
I did it, committed to analytics<br />
Investigator, liberator, a rap grader<br />
The collaborator, mutilator of cross-faders<br />
He's Double-Double, the master moderator, but <span class="grey-text">header</span> hater<br />
Perpetrators'll cop my superpowers in gigawatts<br />
Can't measure it, treasure it, national, I could smash your block<br />
My vinyl weapon like a wrecking ball, I'm just warnin' y'all<br />
Don't stop, ya don't quit, baby, it's all night<br />
My mic is my flashlight, your mic is your Fleshlight<br />
You're dickin' around with rap, you hire me to ghostwrite<br />
On site, I make my albums ghostships, no skippers<br />
Tryin' to battle, like playin' pinball with no flippers<br />
American superhero suds-sippers in house slippers<br />
To gangsta to crip tonight, because...<br />
<br />
[Sung sample:] I wanna be like the bionic man<br />
Break down all doors with one blow from my hand<br />
I wanna be like the bionic man<br />
Break down all doors with one blow from my hand<br />
I wanna be like Starsky & Hutch (and those)<br />
Sweet Charlie's Angels say "look, but don't touch!"<br />
I wanna be like Starsky & Hutch (and those)<br />
Sweet Charlie's Angels say "look, but don't touch!"<br />
<br />
[Double K:] Ay yo, man, check this out... I got this new box, right? I don't know if these superpowers have been acting up lately, but this shit right here?? Yo... it's gonna keep us relevant for the next fifty years! Watch this:<br />
<br />
[Double K:] I am the one who'll be doing the blow<br />
I am the one who'll be smoking the 'dro<br />
You are the one who'll be gettin' no hoes<br />
I am the one changing out of the clothes<br />
I break outta chains and be doing the shows<br />
You fall on the street and breakin' your nose<br />
[Both:] This is for all of my superheroes<br />
This is for all of my superheroes<br />
[Thes One:] I be the one who'll be texting your ho<br />
I be the one who'll be scopin' the booty<br />
I be the one who'll be shoppin' and tradin'<br />
Just bustin' my flows while I pick up some cuties<br />
I be the one who'll be sending them dues<br />
You be the one who'll be hangin' with dudes<br />
I be the one who say "cat's in the tree"<br />
You be the one who'll be lookin' at me...<br />
[Double K:] This is for all of my superheroes
([Thes One:] Lookin' at me...)<br />
This is for all of my superheroes<br />
(Lookin' at me...)<br />
This is for all of my superheroes<br />
I am the one who'll be smoking the 'dro<br />
(... all like Kanye West...)<br />
This is to all of my superheroes<br />
I am the one who'll be smoking the 'dro<br />
(You'll be lookin' at me, lookin' at me...)<br />
Will you shut your ass up?<br />
(Lexus, lookin' at me...)<br />
<br />
([Sung sample:] I wanna be like the bionic man<br />
Break down all doors with one blow from my hand)<br />
[Spoken sample:] Your solution can run out of style... Hey, boys, they stay current... That's right, you've got to stay up to date because you gotta keep checkin' how the problems are changing, so the solution's could be adjusted...<br />
<br />
[Thes One:]<br />
What the fuck these rappers even talking about?<br />
Nowadays, keep it kinda dark like a stout<br />
How I blaze up a phrase<br />
I keep my nine in a Zig Zag, your verb's in a vape pen<br />
Master of the MPC, I'm under the bass when it drop...<br />
([With Double K:]) I mean, did you feel it drop?<br />
Homie, you'll be beggin like, "stop, please!", the loop is like a Regal on D's<br />
Los Angeles people, them OG's swingin' like the palm trees<br />
Off the 110, mind state like, "c'mon, let me kill it!"<br />
Baddest motherfucker slightly south of <span class="grey-text">the Palm</span> Village<br />
And diligent with the diggin'<br />
20/20, my vision of me losing my religion, but shuts me in the spotlight, chillin'<br />
Now you know where I stand, but you demand an autograph for your man<br />
Well, here I am... what you want? ([Double K:] What you want?)<br />
Diss that Pee-Wee and the dinosaur, I'm ready to score<br />
What you want?<br />
<br />
(Oh, my god... look at this calcium. We got so much calcium, fam! You know what I'm sayin'? We been praying to Se√±or Esqueleto! We got mad calcium for all you wack MCs out there. Aight, know what I'm sayin'? Let's go.<br />
<br />
[Double K:] (Ay, ay... let me kick something for your ear real quick... yo...)<br />
Heavily medicated<br />
Super-dope, underrated<br />
MCs, they hella jaded<br />
Ask 'em, the brother made it<br />
Gettin' cheese hella grated<br />
Double, yeah, he the greatest<br />
Suckas be dabbin'<br />
But they don't be rappin'<br />
Talkin' 'bout trappin'<br />
They simpin' and slackin'<br />
Nice award, yeah, these niggas is actin'<br />
Movin' your twist-twist<br />
Ya act like a bitch, bitch<br />
You turn and turn<br />
Watch your crew, they get burned-burned<br />
I'm nice with the mic, right?<br />
Watch it go night-night<br />
Smoke on a spliff, beh<br />
And watch me go on trip<br />
Watch me go ham, bro<br />
Turn up like Rambo<br />
Shootin' a sambo<br />
Now, let's go to Sam's, bro<br />
I'm like an anvil<br />
Hard like steel-steel<br />
Like twins and juice-juice<br />
We told you we hang loose<br />
Hard on the one, fam<br />
Florida Evans go "damn, damn"<br />
Damn on the dab, son<br />
Faded, I'm on one<br />
<br />
(And there you have it: Funkentelechy vs. The Placebo Syndrome... and if you ain't come to party with the P, you know what to do: take your dead ass home! Oh!)<br />
[Both:] Nah, nah nah nah, nah nah nah (repeated)<br />
(There they go... Hey! Ain't nothing but a party!)<br />
[Thes One:] Ooh hoo, hoo hoo, ha ha!</p>
