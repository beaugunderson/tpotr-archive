<h1>Come On, Let's Get High</h1>
<p><strong>Written by: Michael Turner &amp; Christopher Portugal</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>[Double K:] Wake up, cuz! [beatboxes]… Wake up, cuz! [beatboxes]<br />
The homie's telling you to go somewhere… fo' sho'…<br />
Goddamn beer… after one, can't stop… after two, do the Wop… heh heh heh heh…<br />
<br />
[Sung sample:] Come on, let's get high… come on, let's get high (x2)<br />
(Come on, get high!)<br />
<br />
[Double K:] Quarters, pounds, eighths, and halves<br />
Trays and lids, give me a damn nickel bag<br />
Yo, I smoke so much, I'm like Redman's dad<br />
Take a hit from the Sprite can, here's the method, man<br />
Poke holes up on the top, and then crush<br />
Sprinkle the dope, but don't burn too much<br />
And if you need to be discreet, while you're walking down the avenue<br />
Peep your homie, Double K, here's what the brother do<br />
I roll up (Yeah!) and don't give a shit<br />
Blow it in the old lady's wig (Goddamn, boy!), pass it to the kids<br />
I be doing that marijuana before I go to church<br />
Walk in smelling like Otto's jacket<br />
In the morning before I piss, the brotha got to have it<br />
This is serious business, started off as a habit<br />
I smoked the blunt from Germany to France, y'all<br />
And almost died, trying to smoke some hash at the Great Wall<br />
Taking out the life insurance for the herb insurance<br />
Shit, I wrote this on a Zig –Zag, nigga, where the bridge at?<br />
<br />
[Sung sample:] Come on, let's get high… come on, let's get high<br />
(Come on, get high!)<br />
<br />
[Thes One:]<br />
Acid raindrops to acid rainbows<br />
The cereal, bowl-smoking with the bros<br />
Double K knows, he stay puffing like volcanoes<br />
Puffing like a penguin, even when he's in England<br />
He found green, while the chaps smoke the hard with the filter<br />
Cannabis card, he threw the party off-kilter with his big blunt<br />
Man, that shit's like Big Pun's finger<br />
He sweats hash oil, ay-yo, the weed smell lingers<br />
The DJ, the rapper, pothead who's paid ([Double K:] I smoke a lot!)<br />
Lungs probably look like Bob Marley's ashtray<br />
One time, when we were touring deep in Tibet<br />
This monk ran out, his face I'll never forget<br />
He had the sweat on his brow, he said, &quot;Man, what'll we do?<br />
This weed is too strong for all of Katmandhu!&quot;<br />
I said, &quot;Double K? He's my man! If he can't smoke, then no one can!&quot;<br />
He said, &quot;Double K? Well, then he's your man.<br />
If he can't smoke it, then no one can!&quot;… and they got high…<br />
<br />
[Sung sample:] Come on, let's get high… come on, let's get high<br />
(Come on, get high!)<br />
<br />
I'm like Nixon with them victory signs when I score<br />
&quot;Hey, bro, wanna smoke a bowl?&quot; Nah, dude, I need more!<br />
I ain't your blow-in-the-wind, smoke-sometime little hippie<br />
I'm a nigga that be needing that weed, d'ja feel me?<br />
Don't be confused when I'm rolling in your venue<br />
Sound man want dinner, I want smoke on my menu<br />
Getting high than a mother, looking at the girl's toes<br />
Leaning slight to the right, smoking the J through my nose<br />
I smacked the weed right out of Harold and Kumar's hands<br />
Re-light that shit,then pass it off to my man<br />
I heard a rumor that that boy Jamie Foxx smoked<br />
The way I toke ain't a joke, I make Ray go broke (Yeah!)<br />
And all you rappers that claim you get high…<br />
([Sung sample:] Are you high?)<br />
You niggas lie! (Do you get high?)<br />
Niggas… (Do get high?)<br />
Little niggas! (Are you high?… Are you high?)<br />
It's not for kids (Do you get high? [continues])<br />
Matter of fact… Yo, this an anonouncment: everybody, stop smoking!<br />
Ay-yo, Snoop (Yeah!), you don't smoke like me!<br />
Rick Ross (Yeah!), you don't smoke like me!<br />
B-Real (Yeaaah!), you don't smoke like me!<br />
And Dipset niggas? They don't smoke like me!<br />
The boy, B-Legit (Yeah!), he don't smoke like me!<br />
Trey Anastasio (Hahahahaha), you don't smoke like me!<br />
Fab 5 Freddy (Fresh!), you don't smoke like me!<br />
The time I met Ice T, he wouldn't smoke with me, damn…<br />
<br />
[Spoken sample:] Word!<br />
[Sung sample:] Come on, let's get high… come on, let's get high<br />
(Come on, get high!)<br />
([Double K, as Ice T:] &quot;Hell naw, I don't smoke that weed…<br />
Get that shit outta here!&quot;<br />
<br />
[Spoken sample:] Well, that means everything is part of everything else (Uh huh, uh huh)… It really blows my mind! (Trips me out!) Hey, groovy!<br />
<br />
[Man #1:] Hey, man, it's not money!<br />
[Man #2:] What is it, gold?<br />
[Man #1:] No, man, this is where it's at… ice bag?<br />
[Man #2:] Ice bag?<br />
<br />
[Spoken sample:] I'm enjoying it! I'm learning a lot of things I never knew before!<br />
<br />
[Spoken sample:] Do you wanna get high?<br />
<br />
[Man #1:] Hey, what kind of shit is this?<br />
[Man #2:] It's the best, man! I got it from a Negro! You're probably so high already, you don't even know it!</p>
