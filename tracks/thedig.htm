<h1>The Dig</h1> 
<p><strong>Written by: Michael Turner &amp; Christopher Portugal</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>[Rap sample:] I got more beats… you know there's no one finer…<br />
You know there's no one finer… motherfucker…<br />
I know a lot of spots that I ain't putting you up on…<br />
You know there's no one finer… you know there's…<br />
<br />
[Rap sample:] Digging in the crate<br />
[Spoken sample:] All the time<br />
[Rap sample:] Digging in the crate<br />
[Spoken sample:] Right on! (x2)<br />
<br />
[Thes One:]<br />
We got forty crates, black plates, rare grooves, breaks<br />
<span class="grey-text">No</span> 78's, Vietnam era United States<br />
American funk, private label on major turntables<br />
Sunken treasures <span class="grey-text">that's</span> in the 4/4 measures<br />
Now life's only pleasures is digging, I do it often<br />
So when I die, don't cry, put my records in a coffin<br />
And bury me next to a very big tree with my MPC<br />
So they won't warp, as a corpse, remember me<br />
As a daily beat digger that figured out better ways<br />
Of tracking down vinyl, like working at Rhino in the good old days<br />
When the pay came, raised the notch, new spots<br />
Friends with owners, under counters, digging through the new box<br />
45 shoebox to understock rock, records before gas<br />
Wood and glass, fuck it, I'll walk for weeks<br />
And sacrifice heats, looking for beats that coalesce<br />
With chronic, like this here 45 on <span class="grey-text">Microtronics</span><br />
New spots, <span class="grey-text">harmonic to sonic</span>, enhance my life<br />
My records are my children, my ancestors, and my wife<br />
They're there for me, carefully picked and never bit<br />
My record karma stays stronger than the record by the Biz<br />
I known places you don't, did places you won't<br />
Yo, fuck a loop-digger in my city, man, just stay home<br />
You see me by a pay phone on Normandy and King<br />
Don't wonder why as you drive by, I'm doing one thing<br />
Head down, studying my music like Schroeder<br />
Daily digging dust missions wearing out my motor<br />
Fingers full of warts, back aching, arch support failing<br />
Two hours to a new spot, fuck it, we still bailing<br />
In my ride, digging worldwide, bringing heritage home<br />
Reconnaissance, innosense, Renaissance elements<br />
Evidence of long lost musical intelligence, big-picture relevance<br />
<br />
[Rap sample:] Digging in the crate (scratched and repeated)<br />
[Thes One:] The only way my life makes sense<br />
I'm two weeks late paying my rent<br />
I'm digging out the past and the present<br />
And now my fucking money's being spent<br />
The only way my life makes sense<br />
I'm two weeks late paying my rent<br />
I'm digging out the past and the present<br />
The only way my life makes sense<br />
<br />
[Double K:] (Check it out…)<br />
I get my records insured before the life coverage<br />
Up in my room all day, y'all say I'm on some other shit<br />
Digging through the blue, grey, yellow, and green crates<br />
Like I've never done it before, got records scattered on the floor<br />
Got records hanging on the wall and in my bathroom, too<br />
Got stacks up in the hallway, let me put this another way<br />
Yo, I don't give a record dealer nothing but cold cash<br />
And a hard time, pats on my back, 'cause now I'm doing fine<br />
Vinyl is like food, fool, I need it to live<br />
My fingertips been touching wax since I was a small kid<br />
And ever since I been a big Double, it's kinda bad<br />
I sit and just listen to all the money that I had<br />
I drop ten on some smoke, you know where the rest goes<br />
More money to listen to, never dressing for the hos<br />
Fuck clothes, DVD, or holiday and real estate, relationships and bullshit<br />
Ay-yo, I'm digging through the ([Spoken sample:] Crates)<br />
<br />
[Rap sample:] Digging for shit… then I'm going back<br />
(repeated and scratched)<br />
([Double K:] Ha! Hey, Thes, we <span class="grey-text">cooling out</span> right here, <span class="grey-text">boy</span>… yeah… <span class="grey-text">?</span>… hey, alright, aw, fuck it, man, I've seen it all, it don't matter, man, <span class="grey-text">it ain't worth it</span>, it's all good… aw, what's that right there? Ha ha! <span class="grey-text">That's why I'm going</span> digging, man! <span class="grey-text">?</span> no more…<br />
<br />
[Spoken sample:]<br />
[Homie #1:] You remember in Cali when I grabbed <span class="grey-text">one of your</span>… we threw 'em up, yo, we was in Hollywood, right? We's in Hollywood, I grabbed him up, you took his gold, he ain't do nothing, we still got the gold to this day<br />
[Homie #2:] We taxed the kid!<br />
[Homie #3:] Yo, man, I ain't never been…<br />
[Homie #2:] We taxed him…<br />
[Homie #3:] We gonna tax him again<br />
[Homie #1:] And again<br />
[Homie #3:] So just keep your mouth closed<br />
[Homie #1:] I ain't never been taxed before</p>
