<h1>Acid Raindrops (feat. Camel MC)</h1> 
<p><strong>Written by: Michael Turner &amp; Christopher Portugal</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>[Spoken sample:] Out on the porch…<br />
<br />
[Camel MC:]<br />
Let's have a Mid-City Fiesta with your West L.A. connection<br />
Hop inside the vehicle, start crossing intersections<br />
We learning life's lessons while we blaze this herbal essence<br />
A man, but still a child, and I have so many questions<br />
Struggle all my life to evade the misconceptions<br />
Then find a place to live between the negatives and positives<br />
While trying to make money, slanging synonyms and homonyms<br />
I went to pop's house, so I could visit moms and him<br />
Cut to the mall, copped a brand new pair of Timberlands<br />
Then dipped down a one-way, trying to scoop up Double K<br />
And chill with my people on this bright and sunny day<br />
My nigga Spliff was sipping Beck's, I'm slappin hands with <span class="grey-text">guests</span><br />
Locate a shady spot, so we can circulate the stress<br />
Mary Jane invades my brain, now I can't complain<br />
I'm saying: what else is there to do besides relax<br />
Let the problems in your mind become ancient artifacts<br />
Perhaps these raps can help you alleviate<br />
The things that's got you tripping, yo, watch me demonstrate<br />
First, you ignore the nonsense and clear your conscience<br />
Let your pen touch the paper, write verbs and consonants<br />
As the words become a sentence, you start to feeling different<br />
The stress is out your mind, you feel like the weight was lifted<br />
Terrific, I'm glad we had this time to discuss<br />
I'm outro, call me if you wanna blaze one up<br />
<br />
[Camel MC:] When the stress burns my brain just like acid raindrops<br />
Mary Jane is the only thing that makes the pain stop<br />
[Double K:] I let the music take over my soul, body, and mind<br />
[Thes One:] To kick back, relax one time, and you will find<br />
[Camel MC:] When the stress burns my brain just like acid raindrops<br />
Mary Jane is the only thing that makes the pain stop<br />
[Double K:] Just let the music take over your soul, body, and mind<br />
[Thes One:] And kick back, relax one time, and you will find<br />
<br />
[Double K:]<br />
I try to keep it stress-free, take everyday at a time<br />
Make sure the family's in place, and let the music unwind<br />
I got plans to take charge like major outlets<br />
Ride around the country chilling in my L.A. Express<br />
On every street corner, the importance of having fun<br />
Empty bottles, <span class="grey-text">Phill</span> tobacco, don't nobody carry guns<br />
We keep our minds on fun, and let the drums do the banging<br />
On any given day, like Mr. Cooper, yo, we hanging<br />
Under the blue sky, to stay laced in smog<br />
Pollute your quarter-inch cables with all the sound that we brought<br />
Can't get enough, so brother, pass another cold one<br />
Feel like a dad at a ballgame, lamping with his son<br />
Chuck D, y'all, word up, we bugging overtime<br />
From the light to the lime, original Star Time<br />
It's the Double, Chris One, and Camel brought the ammo<br />
So we can shoot game like thugs on your sport channel<br />
Take off the do-rag, replace it with a thinking cap<br />
If you didn't know, tell the bro, he shoulda known that<br />
We here for one thing (what's that?), and that's to remain<br />
What's the name? (name… name…)([<span class="grey-text">Camel MC</span>:] Nigga!)<br />
<br />
[Camel MC:] When the stress burns my brain just like acid raindrops<br />
Mary Jane is the only thing that makes my pain stop<br />
[Double K:] I let the music take over my soul, body, and mind<br />
[Thes One:] To kick back, relax one time, and you will find<br />

[Thes One:] Kick back, relax one time, and you will find<br />
<br />
[Thes One:]<br />
Yo, L.A., hit me one time, make it funky<br />
Double-down on my underground sound, I'm feelin lucky<br />
For this jackpot, I jack spots to fill up my crates<br />
We laid back, chilling, and feeling the music relates<br />
We on the ([Spoken sample:] One!) to the two, hanging with my crew<br />
Bullshitting while we sitting down, drinking on some brew<br />
And 'til the afternoon turns to the moonlight<br />
Funky tracks and nickel sacks, freestyling all night<br />
Doing it right, knowing <span class="grey-text">we're tight, and</span> music may get better<br />
My crew banging through blocks like shots from a Beretta<br />
Snub nose to the hos with problems, I suppose<br />
Honey, you gotta understand: your man's got flows<br />
And I'm leaving you, so By the Time I Get to Phoenix<br />
Underground heads'll fiend this musical genius<br />
Transglobal, by the books, like Barnes with Noble hooks<br />
Armed with overlooked, talented guests, so god bless crooks<br />
Who steal loops and keep this shit alive<br />
Something for your troops to sit around and vibe by<br />
For Camel, Double, and Thes to ease stress<br />
We 'bout to hip hop, so have fun and god bless<br />
<br />
[Camel MC:] When the stress burns my brain just like acid raindrops<br />
Mary Jane is the only thing that makes the pain stop<br />
[Double K:] I let the music take over my soul, body, and mind<br />

<br />
[Double K:]<br />
Pop collars to this, wear ice to this, drink Cris to this<br />
Yo, is there something we missed?<br />
Pop collars to this, wear ice to this, drink Cris to this<br />
Is there something we missed?<br />
Yeah, like my <span class="grey-text">two-way</span>, throw 'bows, and do the shoulder shake<br />
We throwing 'bows up in here, do the shoulder shake<br />
Oh shit, my <span class="grey-text">two-way… oops</span>, my shoulder shake<br />
<span class="grey-text">Arms up</span>, I'm throwin 'bows…<br />
[Double K:] (Alright…) One more time!<br />
<br />
[Sung sample:] There was music, enjoying marijuana<br />
It was flown up fresh this morning from the border</p>
