<h1>Graffiti Rap II</h1>
<p><strong>Written by: Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Michael Turner &amp; Christopher Portugal</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>[Thes One, with echo effect:]<br />
I saw a third--I heard his voice:<br />
It is the Hermit good!<br />
He singeth loud his godly hymns<br />
That he makes in the wood.<br />
He'll shrieve my soul, he'll wash away<br />
The Albatross's blood.<br />
<br />
This Hermit good lives in that wood<br />
Which slopes down to the Sea.<br />
How loudly his sweet voice he rears!<br />
He loves to talk with Marineres<br />
That come from a far Contrée.<br />
<br />
He kneels at morn and noon and eve--<br />
He hath a cushion plump:<br />
It is the moss, that wholly hides<br />
The rotted old Oak-stump.<br />
<br />
The Skiff-boat ne'rd: I heard them talk,<br />
&quot;Why, this is strange, I trow!<br />
&quot;Where are those lights so many and fair<br />
&quot;That signal made but now?<br />
<br />
&quot;Strange, by my faith! the Hermit said--<br />
&quot;And they answer'd not our cheer.<br />
&quot;These planks look warp'd, and see those sails<br />
&quot;How thin they are and sere!<br />
&quot;I never saw aught like to them<br />
&quot;Unless perchance it were<br />
<br />
&quot;The skeletons of leaves that lag<br />
&quot;My forest brook along:<br />
&quot;When the Ivy-tod is heavy with snow,<br />
&quot;And the Owlet whoops to the wolf below<br />
&quot;That eats the she-wolf's young.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dear Lord! it has a fiendish look--<br />
(The Pilot made reply)<br />
&quot;I am afear'd.--&quot;Push on, push on!<br />
&quot;Said the Hermit cheerily.<br />
<br />
The Boat came closer to the Ship,<br />
But I ne spake nor stirred!<br />
The Boat came close beneath the Ship,<br />
And strait a sound was heard!<br />
<br />
Under the water it rumbled on,<br />
Still louder and more dread:<br />
It reach'd the Ship, it split the bay;<br />
The Ship went down like lead.<br />
<br />
Stunn'd by that loud and dreadful sound,<br />
Which sky and ocean smote:<br />
Like one that hath been seven days drown'd<br />
My body lay afloat:<br />
But, swift as dreams, myself I found<br />
Within the Pilot's boat.<br />
<br />
Upon the whirl, where sank the Ship,<br />
The boat spun round and round:<br />
And all was still, save that the hill<br />
Was telling of the sound.<br />
<br />
I mov'd my lips: the Pilot shriek'd<br />
And fell down in a fit.<br />
The Holy Hermit rais'd his eyes<br />
And pray'd where I did sit.<br />
<br />
I took the oars: the Pilot's boy,<br />
Who now doth crazy go,<br />
Laugh'd loud and long, and all the eyes<br />
All the while went to and fro,<br />
&quot;Ha! ha!&quot; quote he--&quot;full plain I see,<br />
&quot;The devil knows how to row.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ha ha… this is crazy…<br />
<br />
And now all in my own Countree<br />
I stood on the firm land!<br />
The Hermit stepp'd forth from the boat,<br />
And scarcely he could stand.<br />
<br />
&quot;O shrieve me, shrieve me, holy Man!<br />
The Hermit cross'd his brow--<br />
&quot;Say quick,&quot; quote he, &quot;I bid thee say<br />
&quot;What manner man art thou?<br />
<br />
Forthwith this frame of mine was wrench'd<br />
With a woeful agony,<br />
Which forc'd me to begin my tale<br />
And then it left me free.<br />
<br />
Since then at an uncertain hour<br />
Now oftimes and now fewer,<br />
That anguish comes and makes me tell<br />
My ghastly aventure.<br />
<br />
I pass, like night, from land to land;<br />
I have strange power of speech;<br />
The moment that his face I see<br />
I know the man that must hear me;<br />
To him my tale I teach.<br />
<br />
What loud uproar bursts from that door!<br />
The Wedding-guests are there;<br />
But in the Garden-bower the Bride<br />
And Bride-maids singing are:<br />
And hark the little Vesper-bell<br />
Which biddeth me to prayer.<br />
<br />
O Wedding-guest! this soul hath been<br />
Alone on a wide wide sea:<br />
So lonely 'twas, that God himself<br />
Scarce seemed there to be.<br />
<br />
O sweeter than the Marriage-feast,<br />
'Tis sweeter far to me<br />
To walk together to the Kirk<br />
With a goodly company.<br />
<br />
To walk together to the Kirk<br />
And all together pray,<br />
While each to his great father bends,<br />
Old men, and babes, and loving friends,<br />
And Youths, and Maidens gay.<br />
<br />
Farewell, farewell! but this I tell<br />
To thee, thou wedding-guest!<br />
He prayeth well who loveth well<br />
Both man and bird and beast.<br />
<br />
He prayeth best who loveth best,<br />
All things both great and small:<br />
For the dear God, who loveth us,<br />
He made and loveth all.<br />
<br />
The Marinere, whose eye is bright,<br />
Whose beard with age is hoar,<br />
Is gone; and now the wedding-guest<br />
Turn'd from the bridegroom's door.<br />
<br />
That… hath…<br />
<br />
He went, like one that hath been stunn'd<br />
And is of sense forlorn:<br />
A sadder and a wiser man<br />
He rose the morrow morn. (heavy echo)</p>
