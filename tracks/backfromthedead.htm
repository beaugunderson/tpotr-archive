<h1>Back From The Dead</h1> 
<p><strong>Written by: Michael Turner &amp; Christopher Portugal</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>[Spoken sample:] Musical dope...<br />
<br />
[Spoken sample:] Wait a minute... I know who you are, I heard you were dead<br />
[Spoken sample:] He dead! (Yessir!) Amen! (Chuuch!)<br />
[Spoken sample:] Rise from your grave!<br />
[Spoken sample:] Death is the final stage of your body, the absolute moment, there is no turning back<br />
<br />
[Thes One:]<br />
Back from the fuckin' dead<br />
Our bodies, they're bodies underground, can't rest my head<br />
Resurrect 'em, collect them ashes, that just what they said<br />
We in the cloud now, streaming City of Angels, double-teamin' these demons<br />
El Ni√±o them Acid Raindrops, and blow your head with my return<br />
The fans have gone and emptied out their "earn"<br />
Well, your reward is I'm the Lord Radio<br />
Rockin' through your Ouija boards, lock your doors<br />
Resurrected the People, want the P, an encore... well, you got it<br />
Furthermore, I'm lightly seasoned with that voodoo, CTI and the Kudu<br />
I walk with that Soul Strut, carry that Golden Era<br />
A legend with no credit, rap music vetted Yogi Berra<br />
Brother, boom! I moved that rock out in front of the tomb<br />
Floating through a lagoon of purgatorious goons<br />
Trying to make it back because you demand it<br />
I try to get some rest, but you seance that rad shit<br />
We'll collect your moonlit trinkets, totems, candles, and talismans<br />
The rebirth from the earth and the Dawn of Man<br />
Poertry, poetry over rhythm, we give 'em oral tradition<br />
Reminiscing off that Malta, modern-day Atahualpa<br />
Thes One, that last Inca, sin falta y sin parar<br />
And so far, we the star that continues to shine<br />
Up from afar, up in the sky, constellation Mike and Chris<br />
Never die, regenesis up out the chrysalis, I feel like fuckin' Sisyphus!<br />
<br />
[Spoken sample:] Say, neighbor, I ain't dead yet!<br />
[Spoken sample:] Congratulations, man. Congratulations.<br />
<br />
[Thes One:] We back from the dead! ([Rap sample:] Resurrect) Ah ha ha. <br />
I said we back from the dead! ([Rap sample:] Resurrect) Woo!<br />
You know we back from the dead! ([Rap sample:] Resurrect)<br />
Ah yes, we back from the dead! ([Rap sample:] Resurrection)<br />
We back from the dead! And we back, and we back, and we back<br />
You know we back from the...<br />
<br />
[Spoken sample:] We are... gathered here today...<br />
([Spoken sample:] And you'll call me back from the dead!)<br />
<br />
[Double K:]<br />
Poor sucka, thought they had the brotha under<br />
But I'm harder than a snare, no intensive care<br />
Brought the other side, lemme show you what it look like<br />
He was coming home, late night, probably on his dirt bike<br />
But I was chillin', livin' ghetto lavish<br />
Joints was passin', good music, we laughin'<br />
Then BANG! I woke up with a sheet of fresh rhymes<br />
Gin and lime, never committed a crime, except...<br />
Me and the homie still active, attracting danger<br />
Attractive, movin' through traffic<br />
When you see us in the rehearse, your mind reverse<br />
Pay attention to the verse<br />
I'm a B-boy, and we don't die<br />
Some join the military and some smoke fry<br />
But the P, we arise, cremation of character<br />
The spirit, we scarin' ya... I'm back on my mic, right?<br />
Writin' my name is lame in the same gang<br />
Blue on blue, blue on black, yo, it's the same thing<br />
I ride with my nigga Joe, and he don't trip<br />
Thes One on that bullshit? Nah, he don't trip!<br />
Mike T, I got some pizza and that Part 2 shit<br />
Who want a fat lip, speakin' on that holy ghost?<br />
You heard what I said, Thes and Double, we back from the dead<br />
You heard what I said, Thes and Double, we back from the dead<br />
<br />
([Spoken sample:] Back from the dead! [repeated and scratched])<br />
[Double K, sped up:] You thought you saw the last of us. You thought we was gone, but we're back! The joke's on you, jack! The joke's on you, jack!<br />
<br />
[Thes One:] We back from the dead! Ah ha ha. <br />
I said we back from the dead! ([Rap sample:] Resurrect) Woo!<br />
You know we back from the dead! ([Rap sample:] Resurrect)<br />
Ah yes, we back from the dead! ([Rap sample:] Resurrection)<br />
We back from the dead! And we back, and we back, and we back<br />
You know we back from the...<br />
We back from the dead! ([Spoken sample:] Yes, sir! Amen!)<br />
<br />
[Spoken sample:] He dead! (Yessir!) Amen! (Chuuch!) He dead! (Yessir!) Amen! (Chuuch!)<br />
<br />
[Spoken sample:] Life is not all that. Get your spirit back.<br />
[Rap sample:] Go and tell everybody! ([Rap sample:] I'm comin' back!)<br />
[Rap sample:] Go and tell everybody! ([Spoken sample:] I ain't dead yet...)<br />
[Rap sample:] I'm comin' back! ([Spoken sample:] And you'll call me back from the dead!)<br />
<br />
[Man #1:] Is he fuckin' dead?<br />
[Man #2:] What the fuck you mean, "Is he fuckin' dead?", guy??<br />
[Man #1:] The fuck you think?<br />
<br />
[Rap sample:] We're not done<br />
[Rap sample:] I'm coming back<br />
[Rap sample:] Resurrection, I'm back from the dead, they told me...<br />
[Spoken sample:] Rise from your grave!<br />
[Rap sample:] I'm coming back<br />
<br />
[Spoken sample:] My question is (Mi pregunta es) if you die today (si tu de muere), leaving the studio (<span class="grey-text">dehan</span> del estudio) in an accident... It is better for you that I go away (que yo me vaya). If I do not go away (si no me <span class="grey-text">fuera</span>), you won't be great (no <span class="grey-text">seran</span> grande usted). My absence (mi ausencia) is your greatness (E tu grandeza... Wow.)<br />
</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Trivia:</strong></p>
<ul><li>Per Thes (as told to me at the 4/20/16 Santa Cruz album release show): despite the play on words of "urn"/"earn" in his first verse, the official lyric is "earn".</li></ul>
<br />
<p><strong>This track appears on the following releases:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href ="../albums/tgos.htm">The Gettin' Off Stage, Part 2 (2016)</a> (CD, Cassette, LP, Download) - PUTS Records</li>
