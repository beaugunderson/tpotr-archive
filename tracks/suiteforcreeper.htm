<h1>Suite For Creeper</h1>
<p><strong>Written by: Michael Turner &amp; Christopher Portugal</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>[Slurred spoken sample:] Mmmmm, man… you know, I'm taking you, you… this is, this is some good stuff!<br />
<br />
[Double K:] Dude… drop you off right here. You go in there, man. Do what you gotta do. Take it cool, man. I'mma be out here waiting for you. I got your back. You just let me know… I got the radio. I'm about to go over to… alright…<br />
[Thes One:] Check it out…<br />
[Double K:] Alright.<br />
<br />
[Thes One:]<br />
The Ruger semi-automatic with anti-lymphatic shells<br />
Kills immune cells and targets at random<br />
<span class="grey-text">Telebox</span> scope in tandem with infrared, every sixth shot is a tracer<br />
MO: Thes One, known to some as &quot;Enemy Eraser&quot;<br />
Now the <span class="grey-text">taser on the bales</span> for a close-up kill<br />
Real tree covers, real <span class="grey-text">team</span> HQ on a hill<br />
Behind a city the committee has chosen as a target<br />
Contact covert agent, she's working in the supermarket<br />
Behind City Hall, slipped the C-4 <span class="grey-text">for</span> the wall<br />
Night before the election, blew a hole in the dairy section<br />
I place a call back, &quot;Special Forces attack!&quot;<br />
The weapon sack pushed through the hole<br />
And crawled towards the goal, 0100 hours, bomb electrical towers<br />
Overpasses cutting communication, transportation for the masses<br />
Night-glasses in place, put the caps in the vase, Austrian Snow Camo<br />
Blend in with the stucco, open the sack for more ammo<br />
Buckled on the gas mask, threw the flash through the glass window<br />
Hit the floor… &quot;Everyone get the FUCK down!<br />
My name is Thes One, I'm 'bout to run shit! Uh… you! [Shot]<br />
And uh, you! [Shot] And uh, you over there! [Shots]…&quot;<br />
<br />
[Thes over radio:] &quot;Yo, Double K… Double K, you hear me, man? Hey, uh… I think we kinda underestimated their, uh… their abilities, man. They got me hemmed down in here, man I can't hold 'em…&quot;<br />
[Double K over radio:] &quot;Ay, fool, you done been in there for over an hour<br />
The way you're talking and smoking<br />
You better come out with some power<br />
Got me posting, riding dirty, circling blocks, got me spooked<br />
Every honky still alive inside, you better shoot<br />
I seen a bitch run screaming, I hope that wasn't your bad<br />
'Cause if it was, we had it, and the pigs'll be mad!&quot;<br />
[Thes One:] &quot;You gotta understand, things are going kinda bad<br />
But before I die, <span class="grey-text">I'll light</span> an acid bomb, and we all can fry!&quot;<br />
[Double K over radio:] Ay-yo, I'm not trying to go out<br />
Like some white adolescent<br />
When I'm riding to the <span class="grey-text">simp of</span> marijuana as the essence<br />
Remember, this was your idea, and I was down and out<br />
When you told me what your plan was about ([Thes One:] I know…)<br />
That you were gonna lower tobacco prices<br />
Make sacks legal (I know, I'm going to!)<br />
All I had to do was get the <span class="grey-text">danky and some regal</span> (you did a good job)<br />
I hope your <span class="grey-text">nuts one</span> thinking with your mouth or <span class="grey-text">with</span> your talking<br />
Just hurry the fuck up <span class="grey-text">(?) some tall walking…</span><br />
(I'm gonna make it out, man, I'm gonna make it out)<br />
<br />
[Thes One:]<br />
I'm running, gunning, and blazing, dipping, diving, and tasing<br />
Clips flying, people dying every which way, as they send<br />
More people after, the mission's a disaster<br />
&quot;Maintain communication, and I'll meet you in an hou-<br />
GOD! OH NO! OH GOD&quot;<br />
[Double K over radio:] &quot;Yo… yo… yo… I know you ain't shot!&quot;<br />
<br />
[Double K:] Got caught by the surveillance and big homie got popped<br />
Now, it's time to go search and get the .4-5 revolver<br />
Mashed down a small street, seen the ones, didn't bother<br />
Put my Nike to the metal, seen him limping down the alley<br />
Busting shots to his rear, trying to make the coast clear<br />
Nigga jumped through the window, and I accelerated<br />
Took down some assholes who swore to God that they made it<br />
[Thes One:] Yeah, yeah, yeah<br />
We're screeching through back-alleys, smelling smoke from the tires<br />
Radio transmissions, headquarters on fire<br />
Five pigs following, I'm swallowing cyanide<br />
&quot;Double K, you've been a good friend, thanks for the ride.&quot;<br />
[Double K:] This punk committed suicide, didn't wanna see time<br />
Kicked him out the passenger door, began to hoo-ride<br />
Pumped off the PCP, I came to a stop<br />
Jumped out, freestyling, double shots at the cops<br />
&quot;Yeah, motherfucker, you ain't never gonna take me<br />
Take this, you fucker, check it ou- OH SHIT! NO! OH! OHHH!<br />
GOD DAMN!&quot; [More shots and grunts]<br />
<br />
[Dolemite sample:] &quot;Wake up… Wake up, man. Wake up! Wake up, man! Who killed Jim?&quot; &quot;W-Wait a minute, man! Wait a min-&quot; &quot;Man, who done it? Who done it?!&quot; &quot;Shit, man, lighten up…&quot; &quot;Who killed Jim.&quot; &quot;Man, hold it, lighten up, bra, I tell ya, I tell ya, man, wait a minute, man… damn!&quot;</p>
