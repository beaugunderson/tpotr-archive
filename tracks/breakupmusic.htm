<h1>Breakup Music</h1> 
<p><strong>Written by: Michael Turner &amp; Christopher Portugal</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>[Double K:] (Mm. Oh, my goodness... I used to love her, I used to love her.)<br />
You love her, you hate her, all of the above<br />
When you first met, she was like an exotic drug<br />
Holdin' hands, on the phone every night until you fall out<br />
Now it seems like every night, you fall out<br />
Mind growin' suspicious, she says you're superstitious<br />
Her attitude vicious, acts growin' malicious<br />
Only worried about her needs and when it comes to yours<br />
She treats it like a chore, never did that before<br />
You get the feelin' like it's comin' to an end<br />
She's drunk with her friends, all your money she spends<br />
It ain't worth it, you workin', she filmin' herself twerkin'<br />
Shit mad concernin', you can feel the rage burnin'<br />
See the page turnin', lookin' at the front door<br />
You thinkin' to yourself, &quot;I can't believe this whore!&quot;<br />
You're gettin' vexed... time to send that final text<br />
She broke the rules in the book, a professional crook<br />
You know you deserve better, it could be a brighter day<br />
Don't wanna end up like Tiger or that boy, O.J.<br />
There's a fork in the road, it's approachin' fast<br />
It's a lesson in life: not all good things last<br />
<br />
This is break-up music, you gotta use it<br />
Hey, baby girl, you're useless<br />
This is break-up music, you gotta use it<br />
And that girl is useless<br />
Break-up music, you gotta use it<br />
Hey, baby girl, you're useless<br />
This is break-up music, you gotta use it<br />
And that girl is useless<br />
<br />
[Rap sample:] That's so <span class="grey-text">despised</span><br />
[Rap sample:] Makin' moves <span class="grey-text">on another</span> fool<br />
[Rap sample:] And I don't think that I can take it anymore...<br />
<br />
[Thes One:]<br />
Hey, girl, you know I love you just like a friend<br />
But every now and then, I get mad 'cause you deserve a ten<br />
And your boyfriend's a zero andI bite my tongue<br />
But tonight, I'm gonna tell you the truth and then some<br />
See, when you not around, the people wonder why you're with him<br />
I know you have suspicion, I see it when you kiss him<br />
And he always borrows something, he's kinda short on cash<br />
He love his mom too much, but he don't even ask her<br />
And she's still makin' payments on his stupid-ass Honda<br />
With no job, said he's enrollin' in Rio Hondo<br />
But don't stop at school to get the enrollment packet<br />
Took his application money, he bought a new jacket<br />
He's a pretty boy, frickin' shop more even than you do<br />
Postin' pics at H&amp;M, emoticon: doo-doo
What I posted, he erased it, he don't frickin' like me<br />
He thinks he's a producer, he jealous of me and Mikey<br />
I try to stay supportive 'cause I know that he's your man<br />
But the truth is he don't have talent or a plan<br />
He's frontin', thinks the world owes him somethin'<br />
And what he do for you, lately, lady? Nothin'!<br />
<br />
This is break-up music, you gotta use it<br />
Homeboy, you're useless<br />
This is break-up music, you gotta use it<br />
That dude is useless<br />
This is break-up music, you gotta use it<br />
That dude is useless<br />
This is break-up music, homegirl, just use it<br />
'Cause that dude is useless<br />
<br />
[Rap sample:] And I regret that I can't take it anymore<br />
[Rap sample:] So I'm leavin' you [repeated and scratched]<br />
<br />
[Announcer:] It's 12SP and a new life<br />
Looks ready to me! (Oh, looks ready to me!)<br />
With Mike and Chris on WRLA!</p>
