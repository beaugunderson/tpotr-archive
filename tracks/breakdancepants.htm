<h1>Breakdance Pants</h1>
<p><strong>Written by: Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Michael Turner &amp; Christopher Portugal</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>[Thes One, with echo effect:]<br />
Yo… sorry for that break. I had to go eat dinner. Woo!<br />
<br />
Listen, O listen, thou Wedding-guest!<br />
&quot;Marinere! thou hast thy will:<br />
&quot;For that, which comes out of thine eye, doth make<br />
&quot;My body and soul to be still.&quot;<br />
<br />
Never sadder tale was told<br />
To a man of woman born:<br />
Sadder and wiser thou wedding-guest!<br />
Thou'lt rise to morrow morn.<br />
<br />
Never sadder tale was heard<br />
By a man of woman born:<br />
The Marineres all return'd to work<br />
As silent as beforne.<br />
<br />
The Marineres all 'gan pull the ropes,<br />
But look at me they n'old:<br />
Thought I, I am as thin as air--<br />
Thou cannot me behold.<br />
<br />
Till noon we silently sail'd on<br />
Yet never a breeze did breathe:<br />
Slowly and smoothly went the ship<br />
Mov'd onward from beneath.<br />
<br />
Under the keel nine fathom deep<br />
From the land of mist and snow<br />
The spirit slid: and it was He<br />
That made the Ship to go.<br />
The sails at noon left off their tune<br />
And the Ship stood still also.<br />
<br />
The sun right up above the mast<br />
Had fix'd her to the ocean:<br />
But in a minute she 'gan stir<br />
With a short uneasy motion--<br />
Backwards and forwards half her length<br />
With a short uneasy motion.<br />
<br />
Then, like a pawing horse let go,<br />
She made a sudden bound:<br />
It flung the blood into my head,<br />
And I fell into a swound.<br />
<br />
How long in that same fit I lay,<br />
I have not to declare;<br />
But ere my living life return'd,<br />
I heard and in my soul discern'd<br />
Two voices in the air,<br />
<br />
&quot;Is it he? quoth one, &quot;Is this the man?<br />
&quot;By him who died on cross,<br />
&quot;With his cruel bow he lay'd full low<br />
&quot;That harmless Albatross.<br />
<br />
&quot;The spirit who 'bideth by himself<br />
&quot;In the land of mist and snow,<br />
&quot;He lov'd the bird that lov'd the man<br />
&quot;Who shot him with his bow.&quot;<br />
<br />
The other was a softer voice<br />
As soft as honey-dew:<br />
Quoth he the man hath penance done,<br />
And penance more will do.<br />
<br />
&quot;But tell me, tell me! speak again,<br />
&quot;Thy soft response renewing--<br />
&quot;What makes that ship drive on so fast?<br />
&quot;What is the Ocean doing?<br />
<br />
&quot;Still as a Slave before his Lord,<br />
&quot;The Ocean hath no blast:<br />
&quot;His great bright eye most silently<br />
&quot;Upon the moon is cast--<br />
&quot;If he may know which way to go,<br />
&quot;For she guides him smooth or grim.<br />
&quot;See, brother, see! how graciously<br />
&quot;She looketh down on him.<br />
<br />
&quot;But why drives on that ship so fast<br />
&quot;Withouten wave or wind?<br />
<br />
&quot;The air is cut away before,<br />
And closes from behind.<br />
&quot;Fly, brother, fly! more high, more high,<br />
&quot;Or we shall be belated.<br />
&quot;For slow and slow that ship will go,<br />
&quot;When the Marinere's trance is abated.<br />
<br />
I woke, and we were sailing on<br />
As in a gentle weather:<br />
Twas night, calm night, the moon was high;<br />
The dead men stood together.<br />
<br />
All stood together on the deck,<br />
For a charnel-dungeon fitter:<br />
All fix'd on me their stony eyes<br />
That in the moon did glitter.<br />
<br />
The pang, the curse from which they died,<br />
Had never pass'd away:<br />
I could not draw my een from theirs<br />
Ne turn them up to pray.<br />
<br />
And in its time the spell was snapt,<br />
And I could move my een:<br />
I look'd far-forth, but little saw<br />
Of what might else be seen.<br />
<br />
Like one, that on a lonely road<br />
Doth walk in fear and dread,<br />
And having once turn'd round, walks on<br />
And turns no more his head:<br />
Because he knows, a frightful fiend<br />
Doth close behind him tread.<br />
<br />
But soon there breath'd a wind on me,<br />
Ne sound ne motion made:<br />
Its path was not upon the sea<br />
In ripple or in shade.<br />
<br />
It rais'd my hair, it fann'd my cheek,<br />
Like a meadow-gale of spring--<br />
It mingled strangely with my fears,<br />
Yet it felt like a welcoming.<br />
<br />
Swiftly, swiftly flew the ship,<br />
Yet she sail'd softly too:<br />
Sweetly, sweetly, blew the breeze--<br />
On me alone it blew.<br />
<br />
O dream of joy! is this indeed<br />
The light-house top I see?<br />
Is this the Hill? Is this the Kirk?<br />
Is thine mine own countrée?<br />
<br />
We drifted o'er the Harbour-bar,<br />
And with sobs did I pray--<br />
&quot;O let me be awake, my God!<br />
&quot;Or let me sleep alway!&quot;<br />
<br />
The harbour-bay was clear as glass,<br />
So smoothly it was strewn!<br />
And on the bay the moon light lay,<br />
In the shadow of the moon.<br />
<br />
The moonlit bay was white all o'er,<br />
Till rising from the same,<br />
Full many shapes, that shadows were,<br />
Like as of torches came.<br />
<br />
A little distance from the prow<br />
Those dark-red shadows were;<br />
But soon I saw that my own flesh<br />
Was red as in a glare.<br />
<br />
I turn'd my head in fear and dread,<br />
And by the holy rood,<br />
The bodies had advanc'd, and now<br />
Before the mast they stood.<br />
<br />
They lifted up their stiff right arms,<br />
They held them strait and tight;<br />
And each right-arm burnt like a torch,<br />
A torch that's borne upright.<br />
Their stony eye-balls glitter'd on<br />
In the red and smoky light.<br />
<br />
I pray'd and turn'd my head away<br />
Forth looking as before.<br />
There was no breeze upon the bay,<br />
No wave against the shore.<br />
<br />
The rock shone bright, the kirk no less<br />
That stands above the rock:<br />
The moonlight steep'd in silentness<br />
The steady weathercock.<br />
<br />
And the bay was white with silent light,<br />
Till rising from the same<br />
Full many shapes, that shadows were,<br />
In crimson colours came.<br />
<br />
A little distance from the prow<br />
Those crimson shadows were:<br />
I turn'd my eyes upon the deck--<br />
O Christ! what saw I there?<br />
<br />
Each corse lay flat, lifeless and flat;<br />
And by the Holy rood<br />
A man all light, a seraph-man,<br />
On every corse there stood.<br />
<br />
This seraph-band, each waved his hand:<br />
It was a heavenly sight:<br />
They stood as signals to the land,<br />
Each one a lovely light:<br />
<br />
This seraph-band, each waved his hand,<br />
No voice did they impart--<br />
No voice; but O! the silence sank,<br />
Like music on my heart.<br />
<br />
Eftsones I heard the dash of oars,<br />
I heard the pilot's cheer:<br />
My head was turn'd perforce away<br />
And I saw a boat appear.<br />
<br />
Then vanish'd all the lovely lights;<br />
The bodies rose anew:<br />
With silent pace, each to his place,<br />
Came back the ghastly crew.<br />
The wind, that shade nor motion made,<br />
On me alone it blew.<br />
<br />
The pilot, and the pilot's boy<br />
I heard them coming fast:<br />
Dear Lord in Heaven! it was a joy<br />
The dead men could not blast.</p>
