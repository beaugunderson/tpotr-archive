<h1>Stay Home</h1>
<p><strong>Written by: Michael Turner &amp; Christopher Portugal</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>[Sung sample:] …Really wish I'd stayed home and gotten high<br />
Instead of coming into the street and having this awful fight…<br />
<br />
[Thes One:]<br />
Yo, in the darkness under the stairs, shadow casting a silhouette<br />
Pair of MCs, scribbling elegies by candle at night<br />
Our dead writers losing lives, your rhyme fights, trying to bite<br />
Losing the limelight to the P, who's undercover in some L.A. hats<br />
Forty days in the studio, struck water from ADATs<br />
On top a mountain made of milk crates, throwing the tablet down<br />
On top of breaks, then dub it to black tapes for the chosen<br />
People who still living the folklore of DJ Cool Herc<br />
Bam and Grand Wizard Theodore<br />
Before any punk with a keyboard could do it<br />
Yo, Apache was the shit, and every B-Boy knew it<br />
And so we do it 'cause we follow original rules<br />
When only microphones and old records were tools<br />
Flash-forward, twenty years later, they calling us &quot;haters&quot;<br />
Yo, popular rappers call it &quot;progress,&quot; they ain't no greater<br />
Than late Seventies disco, Puffy is sounding simple<br />
Yo, it's number one rap? I'd rather hear an 808 handclap than that<br />
Miscontrolled use of culture that I love and grew up in<br />
So many of the wrong motherfuckers blew up in the late Nineties<br />
Here it is, either love your artform, or be a star in showbiz<br />
And get paid or get money, me and Double K'll sit back with a sack, yo<br />
And just monkey with funky breaks that <span class="grey-text">pressing</span> on black <span class="grey-text">plates</span><br />
Paying homage to crates to spread across US states<br />
Making show dates, digging in crates, paying dues<br />
We're a local, national, international crew<br />
<br />
[Double K:]<br />
Never thought when I was coming up, that I would be the average<br />
Skateboarding, football playing, I was into staying in the house<br />
Dropping needles on albums I didn't know about, A.M. stereo<br />
Frequently, I never cared about wrestling and ice cream trucks<br />
Just wanted to ride with my cousin, EJ, because his car had bumps<br />
My brother <span class="grey-text">Sweater</span> picked me up, bumped loud down Crenshaw<br />
To his pad in Gardena, where he let a nigga get off<br />
Gave me doubles of Funky Drummer, took the rest of the crates<br />
Locked me up inside his room, fourteen years later, I'm straight<br />
And y'all should blame it on that man, for the havok I wreak<br />
Taught me to speak through techniques and never critique<br />
A DJ with no rhythm, just pull the plug and be out<br />
Get some records from that fool, that's what I'm talking about<br />
And know niggas like that, to me, get 'nuff respect<br />
Cash checks, carry techs, believe in SP12's<br />
Raise hell about their vinyl if it's not in its place<br />
Can rock a house with two crates and always showing up late<br />
And, yo, to y'all. I say &quot;thanks,&quot; and I'm a keep it riding to never<br />
And Double's in this…<br />
<br />
[Sung sample:] Forever<br />
[Double K:] And Thes One's in this…<br />
[Sung sample:] Forever<br />
[Double K:] And Double K's in this…<br />
[Sung sample:] Forever<br />
[Double K:] And Thes One's in this…<br />
[Sung sample:] Forever<br />
[Double K:] Yo… and, yo, the P's in this…<br />
[Sung sample:] Forever<br />
[Double K:] And Double K's in this…<br />
[Sung sample:] Forever<br />
[Double K:] And Thes One's in this….<br />
[Sung sample:] Forever<br />
[Double K:] Yo, and L.A.'s in this…<br />
[Sung sample:] Forever<br />
[Double K:] What?<br />
[Sung sample:] Forever<br />
[Double K:] Yeah…<br />
[Sung sample:] Forever</p>
