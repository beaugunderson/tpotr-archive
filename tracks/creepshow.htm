<h1>Creepshow</h1>
<p><strong>Written by: Michael Turner &amp; Christopher Portugal</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>[Spoken sample:] You, he, and your <span class="grey-text">color</span>… the time to <span class="grey-text">flow</span>… and since you're alone… I won't believe you anymore…<br />
<br />
([Double K:] I'm feeling creepy!)<br />
<br />
[Thes One:] [babbles]<br />
I'm feeling full-moon, black hat, high when I'm not high<br />
Uncomfortable with my own thoughts, I'm that like guy<br />
Mumbling around Chinatown, lost in a dream<br />
Hey now, remind myself: it's not what it seems<br />
Keep seeing these pink trucks with one big, black letter<br />
<span class="grey-text">What are they trying to sow</span>, I cannot understand better<br />
The pay phone rings every time that I walk by<br />
I keep seeing Tupac, did Tupac not die?<br />
Somebody explain, what's wrong with my brain<br />
I maintain a thin line of sanity, Hannity's the devil<br />
And I could be hearing Satan, <span class="grey-text">waiting</span>, talk on Fox<br />
<span class="grey-text">Plus all who wanna ride</span>, Michael died from the Moonwalk?<br />
The lizard people? The wizard people? Chemtrails?<br />
Nigerian e-mails? Hey, I might be a millionaire!<br />
Random spam, anagrams, Santana-colors, and a major migrane<br />
Undercover <span class="grey-text">paid… EPMD and whether research here</span><br />
So I relax, got midget porn on Betamax<br />
Eating Triscuts, erasing old diskettes and DAT tapes<br />
Stalking old girlfriends on Classmates.com<br />
I'm one of those guys in Cinnabon at the mall in a disguise<br />
In Victoria's Secret for no reason… &quot;Hey, what y'all wearing this season?<br />
Hey what you gonna buy this season? Ha!&quot;<br />
<br />
[Double K:] I feel creepy, I can't stand myself<br />
I feel creepy, man, I think I need help<br />
I feel creepy, I can't stand myself<br />
I feel creepy, man, I think I need help<br />
I feel creepy, I feel creepy, I feel creepy, I can't stand myself<br />
I feel creepy, I feel creepy, I feel creepy, man, I think I need help!<br />
<br />
[Double K:]<br />
Yo, I got a crush on this dame I know<br />
I got her number one night, seen her in the front row<br />
Now, lemme tell you something 'bout this chick, my nig<br />
She has some really nice feet and lived alone with her kid<br />
Now Mr. Too Cool couldn't find his balls<br />
I spent a lot of time making obscene phone calls<br />
On the pay phone at the corner of my pad<br />
Breathing hard in the end 'til she hung up mad<br />
Then I go home and sit naked in the dark<br />
Listening to Prince with my hand over my heart<br />
Asking, &quot;Why did I become this dude?&quot;<br />
Is it the drugs or something that happened in grade school?<br />
Just then, I remembered this girl in my class<br />
I think it was Health when I exposed myself<br />
Got sent home feeling like a fat little creep<br />
I guess that explains why I watch porn in my sleep<br />
Now, back to the chick who heightened my foot fetish<br />
Had me feeling like Rerun, praying to the letters<br />
I wanna break in her house, bust a nut on her bed<br />
While she's at work, and kick back and drink a Squirt<br />
At the end of the day, I sent flowers to the crib<br />
With a suicide note, telling her what I did<br />
Better yet, I'll go and kidnap her kid<br />
Tell that nigga I'm his pappy, and I want our family happy<br />
Now, these are just thoughts with no plan of execution<br />
Street lights in the night? To me, that's pollution<br />
I don't wanna see, damn, I'm getting sleepy<br />
God damn… I feel creepy!<br />
<br />
[Double K:] I feel creepy, I can't stand myself<br />
I feel creepy, man, I think I need help<br />
I feel creepy, I can't stand myself<br />
I feel creepy, man, I think I need help<br />
I feel creepy, I feel creepy, I feel creepy, I can't stand myself<br />
I feel creepy, I feel creepy, I feel creepy, dude, I think I need help!<br />
<br />
[Girl:] I got it! Hello?<br />
[Double K:] Yeah.<br />
[Girl:] Who it this?<br />
[Double K:] What you doing?<br />
[Girl:] Why are you calling my house? Who is this?<br />
[Double K:] Oh… oh…<br />
[Girl:] What?<br />
[Double K:] Oh…<br />
[Girl:] Mike, is that you?<br />
[Double K:] Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, don't hang up, don't hang up, it's me, it's me, it's me<br />
[Girl:] Oh, my God. Who is this? I'll fucking call the cops. Don't call my house.<br />
[Double K:] Uh huh, Put your foot on the phone. Just put your foot on the phone.<br />
[Girl:] I'm gonna call the cops, okay? I'm not fucking around.<br />
[Double K:] God damn it, put your foot on the phone! Fucking bitch!<br />
[Girl:] Who are you? Why are you calling my house?<br />
[Double K:] Stupid… oh… where's that little nappy-haired kid of yours, I'mma kill the nigga<br />
[Girl screams]<br />
[Double K laughs]<br />
([Spoken sample:] Word!)</p>
