<h1>This Lifetime</h1>
<p><strong>Written by: Michael Turner &amp; Christopher Portugal</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>[Spoken sample:] She look good, man. She look good… she look good… word, she look good… but it's just that… you know…<br />
<br />
[Double K:]<br />
I ain't heard from you, baby, so what's happenin'<br />
I know it's been a minute, I've been out here rappin' and<br />
But see, you on mind everytime I see a dime, 'cause yo…<br />
My girl… been in your mind, girl?<br />
I'm just a part-time man, convenient on the sidepiece<br />
Meet up on the sidestreets, love on fine linen<br />
I guess that's all I'm givin', you say I'm wild and crazy<br />
But never would I hesitate to make you my lady<br />
And give you my baby, but see, you're growin' up still<br />
And I don't wanna slow you down, you're life is all uphill<br />
Do your thang, little mama, 'cause I will<br />
Even though with you being on my mind that kills<br />
Yo, it's just another shot of vodka in the glass<br />
Yeah, it's just another love story from the past<br />
I guess I'm too blind to see, and that's so fine with me<br />
Back in the day, I heard about the fish in the sea<br />
So I delete your number and go to the beach<br />
Just wanna let you know cutie, I'm never far to reach<br />
I wish we coulda had a little bit more<br />
But not in this lifetime, I say no more<br />
<br />
[Thes One:] See, in the end, we coulda been<br />
Much more than friends<br />
[Double K:] But not in this lifetime<br />
But not in this lifetime<br />
[Thes One:] There's no denying something's there<br />
Or that you care<br />
[Double K:] But not in this lifetime<br />
But not in this lifetime<br />
[Thes One:] Man, in the end, we coulda been<br />
Much more than friends<br />
[Double K:] But not in this lifetime<br />
But not in this lifetime<br />
<br />
[Thes One:]<br />
We used to write notes, seventh grade and first kisses<br />
Stay up late on the phone against your parents wishes<br />
In homeroom, passing notes with Quiet Storm quotes<br />
Long hopes, immediate dreams, it seems so long ago<br />
But then we graduated, went our separate ways and drifted<br />
You got plagued with self-doubt and never admitted you're gifted<br />
And I found music, and all you found were fake friends<br />
And we found we couldn't connect, the phone call ends<br />
But you would stick to it, watch my fame from afar<br />
In your passing car, two lives aligned with different stars<br />
Now you want to reconnect, but to what? In a rendezvous?<br />
Not telling your husband, man? I think his friends are onto you<br />
Your tangled web woven out of satin is a knot<br />
And I'm so tied up, unreplied messages in inbox<br />
To the trash, before we crash, obsession with the past<br />
A temptation overdose leads to shattered love glass<br />
<br />
[Thes One:] See, in the end, we coulda been<br />
Much more than friends<br />
[Double K:] But not in this lifetime<br />
But not in this lifetime<br />
[Thes One:] There's no denying something's there<br />
Or that you care<br />
[Double K:] But not in this lifetime<br />
But not in this lifetime<br />
[Thes One:] See, in the end, we coulda been<br />
Much more than friends<br />
[Double K:] But not in this lifetime<br />
But not in this lifetime<br />
[Thes One:] There's no denying something's there<br />
Or that you care<br />
[Double K:] But not in this lifetime<br />
But not in this lifetime<br />
<br />
[Double K:] …And I wish things could have worked out for the better, but I guess it's all for the best, you know? No one wants to be uncomfortable in life, and everyone wants to be truthful with themselves and with the person they love, you know? So, until this next lifetime, I'll see you there…<br />
<br />
[Sung sample:] It's déjà vu whenever I'm with you…</p>
