<h1>The Turndown (feat. Assault)</h1>
<p><strong>Written by: Michael Turner, Christopher Portugal &amp; K. Witcher</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>[Thes One:]<br />
Yo, I think this time, I've found a shorty for me<br />
We talk a lot, take walks a lot, she doesn't bore me<br />
In fact, she won't ignore me when I speak in music matters<br />
She's intelligent, fly style flatters my own style<br />
Chickens scatter when she floats through the club<br />
Child matters… love, I'm thinking<br />
I met her one night, drinking our success of a show<br />
She walked up and said, &quot;I know you<br />
You're from the P.U.T.S. I think your name is Thes, too.&quot;<br />
I said, &quot;Would you like a soda? I'm underage.&quot;<br />
Slipped her a number, tipped the waiter<br />
Said, &quot;Give me a page later&quot;<br />
In typical Latin lady flavor, she said &quot;maybe…<br />
Claro que si&quot;, that's how it should be<br />
And see, she played me close, next night, dinner<br />
The champagne toast, sunset Pacific Coast<br />
And mostwhile, everything to me was like tight groovy<br />
Always a treat, man, she took me to the movies<br />
Made love to beats, woke up and made me pancakes<br />
And this point, I knew my shit was Land O' Lakes<br />
Fellas, I might be in love, but something's still not right<br />
We didn't fight, but she didn't call me last night<br />
She got mad loot, no jobs, and plus a high rent<br />
A cellular phone to check the Pac Bell message center<br />
Which she does too much, and I'm really not with it<br />
She tells me that she loves me, so I guess I'm committed<br />
<br />
[Song sample:] Turndown days… always, always<br />
[Thes One:] Guess I love her…<br />
[KRS-One sample:] It gets better! This girl's kinda clever!<br />
<br />
[Double K:]<br />
Yo, I was cooling at the club, about ten on the dot<br />
Drinking Hennesey and Coke, feeling like Tupac<br />
Me and the crew hit the stage in about a half of one<br />
Trying to ditch security 'cause I'm under twenty-one<br />
Just then, I see this fine Latin chick walk past<br />
Face like never before, body like an hourglass<br />
So I was looking at the booty, it was looking right back<br />
You woulda thought she wanted loot, but it wasn't like that<br />
Yo, this girl stepped to me, asked me what was my name<br />
I told her, &quot;Mike,&quot; she looked with a grin, said, &quot;That's right!&quot;<br />
Then for a minute, I started to wonder how she knew who I was<br />
Yo, we've been doing mad shows with the underground buzz<br />
Then I asked her her name… yo, I heard that somewhere<br />
Matter of fact, I had, but yo, the K didn't care<br />
All I wanted was the ass, only that and nothing more<br />
Talked a cool 15 minutes, got the number, hit the floor<br />
Saw Thes, gave him the DAT, we rocked the show<br />
Woke up the next day… aww shit, here we go<br />
Seen a number in the pager that I didn't recognize<br />
Matched it up with the little paper received last night<br />
Word up, I'm 'bout to hit the skins like it was my first<br />
Returned the call, got the address, and quenched my thirst<br />
Took a quick shower, was out in five minutes<br />
Big grin on my grill 'cause I knew I'd be up in it<br />
Her crib wasn't far, so I strolled down the road<br />
Kinda high off the blunt, banging on the front door<br />
She opened up, still in her nightclothes<br />
Foreplay was in effect before I closed the front door<br />
You know how it goes, fingers in her shoobie-doobie<br />
Whispered in her ear that I wanted her to do me<br />
And we did it, homeboy, all day and night<br />
But even after that, something still wasn't right<br />
What the fuck Thes' beat-tape doing on your nightstand?<br />
Yo, I figured it out, it was a gameplan<br />
I asked her what's up, she said, &quot;I got a man!&quot;<br />
And I got a what, what, what, what?!?<br />
<br />
[Song sample:] Turndown days… always, always<br />
[KRS-One sample:] It gets better! It gets better!<br />
<br />
[Assault:]<br />
Y'all didn't see me all day, I stayed at the <span class="grey-text">beta</span> waiting<br />
The car from the maiden I had met when I was chasing<br />
Down the bus, which I missed, but I wasn't too pissed<br />
When I spotted the sis, who lit my eyes like the trees<br />
They put up on Christmas<br />
I said, &quot;Hey! How are you doing today?&quot;<br />
She said, &quot;Aight&quot;, the frame was tight, so I continued her way<br />
Shooting the breeze like L.A., conversation was cool<br />
She went to school, had a job, and no meat was the rule<br />
Now, not to send like a gay librarian<br />
I appreciate the fact you're vegetarian<br />
&quot;I eat some flesh once in a while,&quot; was her reply<br />
And then she looked at me with <span class="grey-text">that one</span> look in her eye<br />
I said, &quot;What? I'm not your kind of nigga?&quot;<br />
&quot;Not quite, but I'll be very interested to hang out with you tonight<br />
I go both ways,&quot; whoa, huh, this girl's a sick puppy<br />
But when she chills at the crib, I'll probably get lucky<br />
But she never showed… all day… missed work…<br />
Bitch never showed up, man… I think she's a bisexual, too…<br />
She had a fat ass…<br />
[Rap sample:] The moral to the story!<br />
[Assault:] It was like red… kinda like reddish-brown…<br />
[Rap sample:] The moral to the story!<br />
[Assault:] Yup, said she, like, uh…<br />
[Double K:] Hold up! Where'd she stay at?!<br />
[Assault:] Uh, like, like, uh, Culver City or something…<br />
[Double K:] Awwww!<br />
[Thes One:] Wait a second… Shit!…<br />
[Assault:] What? Huh?<br />
[Thes One:] Naw, dude!<br />
[Double K:] What's wrong with you?<br />
[Thes One:] Naw, dude! Naw, dude!!<br />
[Assault:] What kind of car she drove?<br />
[Double K:] She had a little Honda or something…<br />
[Assault &amp; Double K:] NOOOOO!!! No! Naw, dude!<br />
[Rap sample:] Fuck police that freak <span class="grey-text">and ca…</span></p>
