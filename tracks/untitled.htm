<h1>Untitled (feat. Scarub &amp; Murs)</h1>
<p><strong>Written by: Michael Turner, Christopher Portugal, Armon Collins &amp; Nick Carter</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>[Garbled sample:] Going have to tell them people them have to fight today… What are you gonna tell a man… It'a alright… Gotta face the truth, gotta fight!… Fight it all, fight 'em off…<br />
<br />
[Scarub:]<br />
Children of a lesser God, illusionalized by landslide<br />
Over less than man's pride, and I pride myself<br />
As being one of the selected few to be able to undo the lifeline of swine<br />
Through a mic line with divine rhyming capability and congenital agility<br />
Scarub is the man, filling your audio<br />
<span class="grey-text">Adding azimuth</span> of your audio frequencies<br />
Freaking the inner ear, inner space of your membrane<br />
Now how do you feel? Be honest now and speak or forever<br />
Hold your peace, and I hold mine, and together, we'll piece together<br />
The parts of hip-hop that we find puzzling and muzzle the muscle men<br />
With surface but with no substance, but the world by circumference<br />
Will colonize the colonies, castrate the wannabes<br />
And liberate the underground sound with respect<br />
I used to hate when they'd call me a roughneck, now I see the truth<br />
Still resent the name, but accept that I'm a part of the game<br />
Seperating hip-hop from shame…<br />
As the world turns, you can find Siam standing on top of soapboxes<br />
In the park, talking to people after dark<br />
<br />
[Murs:]<br />
Now, I can stand alone in the room with the microphone<br />
In the rap stance, ask for perfection, I come too close for comfort<br />
Like a lap dance, so rap fans slap trance states<br />
So they guaranteed to buy a tape, next day, go to school late<br />
'Cause they don't snap out of that shit until sometime around eight<br />
And for all of y'all who hate, thought to buy a tape, but didn't?<br />
Nigga, get my money, why you bullshitting?<br />
And somebody call Scott Paar, 'cause the survey says I'm &quot;too sweet&quot;<br />
When I MC, stand sugar-free, spitting street gospel, a hostile apostle<br />
An earth underground <span class="grey-text">posse</span> from the tonsils to the tongue to the lips<br />
I spit that dope shit to help my crew bubbulate, more tapes I dubulate<br />
The longer the legend lives on, mouth-to-mouth resuscitation<br />
What I give each song: CPR, creating perfect rhymes<br />
That's why I'm looking at your ass crazy for all the times you ask me<br />
Is my shit hot? Nigga, the taste flame-broiled, find it deep underground<br />
In some unnamed soil, a wolf in sheep's clothing<br />
<span class="grey-text">Fo' both yo explode</span>, rock the mic in my <span class="grey-text">style</span>, big Murs<br />
([Rap sample:] Rolling hard and I could <span class="grey-text">pee on top of prophets</span><br />
[Rap sample:] <span class="grey-text">Better little punked out and run…</span>)<br />
<br />
[Thes One:]<br />
In the concrete jungle, there's no natural selection<br />
But in the pretense, perfection is plausible<br />
The P.U.T.S. break the food chain and swallow all fools whole<br />
<span class="grey-text">Hollow</span> out souls scribe, timeline's Mister Majestic<br />
When I write rhymes, I use acrostic <span class="grey-text">telestic</span> methods to spread text<br />
Like butter on musical bars<br />
Me <span class="grey-text">and Monster</span> are like white guys in Mexican bars<br />
Rhymes fight, time like starshine light exist forever<br />
In every endeavor, I write, remain tight like bolts<br />
Stuck in the groove, my beat's smooth like Colt 45<br />
Dude, I promise you when I die, I'll reappear in the sky<br />
And bless <span class="grey-text">shurling</span> on a mountaintop<br />
My rhymes can't stop like trucks on big hills<br />
Me, dropping a mics tonight, wishing for ills<br />
In a mouth, not sex, oratorally complex<br />
I text-plagiarize not, I sip a hot thought on a cool track<br />
Step back, watch a spot get rocked, a bitch<br />
Bitch, switch a style and give me a call<br />
You kill me, when I'm guilty, they'll be a picture of me<br />
On the dashboard of every Latino's taxi<br />
<br />
[Double K:]<br />
Yeah… yo… y'all niggas been rapping for a minute<br />
Ain't even learned your ABCs, instead your &quot;innovative&quot;<br />
And all I can say is: &quot;please pass the mic to the homie<br />
Or that fool over there.&quot; Better yet<br />
Turn that shit off, <span class="grey-text">place</span> immediately and find a chair.<br />
Think about what you doing to slowly work your way up.<br />
'Cause the pace that you moving, it make me wanna erupt<br />
Like the hood in '92 when niggas got buckwild<br />
'Cause you don't go by the rules of &quot;no biting allowed&quot;<br />
Instead you think that shit is funny, Mr. Rapper <span class="grey-text">Don-ski</span><br />
Jonathan Blazer, but I'm pulling out the Taser<br />
Same exact model that they used on Mr. King<br />
But you ain't smoked no loop and it's a whole different scene<br />
I'd rather go head-up on the mic, and when we done<br />
We smack the shit out your DJ for that beat that <span class="grey-text">is butt</span><br />
Now he's <span class="grey-text">turntablist</span> and us three, we rolling hard<br />
Moving city-to-city, pulling stupid niggas' card<br />
Ain't got the heat for protection, but if you wanna have fun<br />
I got my peoples in Regals and Jheri-curls <span class="grey-text">weaving</span> shotgun<br />
No, nigga, I'm not the one and I'm not talking shit<br />
It's just a warning to you gentlemen who wanna take that risk<br />
We the hardest niggas in motion, I put that on my turf<br />
People Under The Gangsta Steps, never getting burnt<br />
My nigga Murs, Scary, Double K, and Thes One…<br />
[Rap sample:] Haha ha hahaha…<br />
[Double K:] Yeah…<br />
[Rap sample:] Uh, with my three-eight-five shot…<br />
[Double K with rap sample:] … I bust the Bumbo Klaat… what…<br />
([Rap sample:] Rolling hard and I could <span class="grey-text">pee on top of prophets</span><br />
[Rap sample:] <span class="grey-text">Better little punked out and run…</span>)<br />
[Double K:] Crescent Heights in the place… and all my niggas…<br />
[Rap sample:] Haha ha hahaha…<br />
[Rap sample:] Uh, with my three-eight-five shot, I bust the Bumbo Klaat<br />
[Double K:] Yeah, uh… know what I'm saying? This for all y'all weird-ass niggas out there… Y'all little pussy-ass niggas… Don't know what the fuck y'all doing when y'all stepping up to the mic, and fucking with L.A.… And you done fucked wit' it… And you done got niggas pissed off… Y'all little wannabe… Little wannabe hip-hop dudes… Suck my…</p>
