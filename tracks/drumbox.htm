<h1>Drumbox</h1>
<p><strong>Written by: Michael Turner &amp; Christopher Portugal</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>[Homie #1 (Double K):] Ay-yo, man, looks like Thes One and Double K over there!<br />
[Homie #2 (Double K):] Great! Give me the twelve inch… let's listen to it. Put it on…<br />
<br />
[Double K:]<br />
Well, here's two brothers from our neighborhood<br />
They guaranteed to rock a beat, and rock a beat good<br />
So, c'mon, Double K and Thes One, for me<br />
Get on the microphone, so all your friends can see<br />
We're all backing you up one hundred percent<br />
We know your time is here, now this is it<br />
If somebody out there like what I said<br />
Somebody yell, &quot;Go 'head!&quot;<br />
[Crowd:] Uh, go 'head!<br />
[Double K:] Uh, go 'head!<br />
[Crowd:] And go 'head!<br />
[Double K:] And you don't stop<br />
Uh, one time for your mind, uh, party people<br />
Two times for the rhyme, uh, Thes One, rrruh!<br />
<br />
[Thes One:]<br />
Thes One is here, so stop your messing around<br />
I leave your sucka MCs like a sad-faced clown<br />
I keep my JVC with batteries when rolling around<br />
And Cambridge Boulevard is where the homie get down<br />
Now, girl, you could be a liar or a two-faced freak<br />
Because it really doesn't matter when I start to speak<br />
I got a whole lotta charm, I compliment you galore<br />
We take a ride on the train, I'm wearing suits of velour<br />
'Cause I know you got my picture on your bedroom door<br />
And after one night of loving, you'll be asking for more<br />
You might call my house, but I won't answer the phone<br />
I'm just a king on a throne, and I'mma leave you alone<br />
I got Susie and Maria, can't forget Roxanne<br />
Got Lisa and Janelle, Jessica and plus Ann<br />
And they all know who's the man with party people control<br />
He's just a cool Latin lover with a whole lotta soul, yyyah!<br />
<br />
[Both:]<br />
Now, everywhere we go, and everything we do<br />
Is just a funky fresh style that we rock for you<br />
[Thes One:] It's Double K<br />
[Double K:] And Thes One<br />
[Both:] And we rock the best<br />
From the North to the South, the East and the West<br />
For the ladies' delight and party people galore<br />
We are the ones that you adore<br />
[Thes One:] So, Double K, get on the mic<br />
And brother, do your thing<br />
Take this microphone and rap like you know what I mean<br />
<br />
[Double K:]<br />
It's a hit! Hear it on your radio box<br />
Blasting in the ghetto by your favorite jocks<br />
And the scratching is fresh and the beat is dope<br />
I'm profiling on the tube with my man, Bob Hope<br />
I'm like drugs to the dope fiends hanging around<br />
And I super-produce to make your friends get down<br />
And that's right, I'm hyped, and homeboys alike<br />
I'm gonna take your position and leave your crew wishing<br />
They were never born 'cause I hunt 'em down<br />
And make 'em understand why I came to town<br />
You see, Reagan's in office, but you better vote<br />
For the brown-skinned Leo with the golden throat<br />
And say &quot;yes&quot; to this and say &quot;no&quot; to all of that<br />
And I promise to you to keep the jam real packed for you<br />
Now, run and tell your buddies that you got rocked<br />
By a couple of old fools and a fresh beatbox, rrrah!<br />
<br />
[Both:]<br />
Everywhere we go, and everything we do<br />
Is just a funky fresh style that we rock for you<br />
[Thes One:] It's Double K<br />
[Double K:] And Thes One<br />
[Both:] And we rock the best<br />
From the North to the East, the South and the West<br />
And pretty ladies' delight and party people galore<br />
We are the ones that you adore<br />
We are the ones that you adore<br />
We are the ones that you adore… rrrah!<br />
<br />
[Thes One:] Yeah…<br />
[Both:] Rrrah!<br />
[Double K:] Scratching… scratch, scratch, scratch, scratching!<br />
[Thes One:] Hah! (repeats)<br />
[Double K:] Get a load of my DJ, a load of my DJ! Scratching! Cut it up! Cut it up, w-wicked! That's my DJ! Know what I'm saying?<br />
[Thes One:] Fresh…<br />
[Double K:] Funky fresh!<br />
[Thes One:] It's fresh…<br />
[Double K:] Scratching, scratching, scratching!<br />
[Thes One:] We're fresh…<br />
[Double K:] C'mon, K, scratch it up! W-wicked! Hup!<br />
[Thes One:] We're fresh… fresh… so fresh… so fresh, uh, fresh… fresh!<br />
[Double K:] That's my DJ… So damn fresh! Scratching for you, scratching for me, and the whole damn crew… scratching, scratching… just scratching, scratching…<br />
[Thes One:] Fresh…<br />
[Double K:] Scratching it up! Just scratching it up! Rrruh!</p>
