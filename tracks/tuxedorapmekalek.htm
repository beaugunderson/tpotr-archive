<h1>Tuxedo Rap (DJ Mekalek Party Mix)</h1>
<p><strong>Written by: Michael Turner, Christopher Portugal, Shawn Jackson, Eric Latham, Jayson Sonico &amp; Jay Gatsby</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>[Rap sample:] Cre-Creased up, staying dressed to impress…<br />
[Sung sample:] Woo!<br />
[Double K:] Rock! For all the hip-hop lovers… in the place to be, we got the P-U-T-S, Time Machine, so fresh… My man, Shawn Jackson, we run it like this… look, rock! Everybody, y'all…<br />
([Background PUTS samples:]<br />
[Thes One:] The People Under The Stairs…<br />
[Double K:] Get with it, everybody, let's up, up, up<br />
[Rap sample:] Time Machine is in the house…)<br />
[Double K:] Put 'em up! Put 'em up!<br />
([Background PUTS samples:]<br />
[Thes One:] The People Under The Stairs…<br />
[Double K:] We're the ones who rock… soul sista!<br />
[Thes One:] Just throw up your hands from side-to-side<br />
And let me know you're alright, let me know you're alright (repeats))<br />
[Sung sample:] Woo!<br />
<br />
[Jaysonic:]<br />
It's the Tuxedo Rap, this a black-tie affair<br />
Time Machine is in the house like an easy chair<br />
People Under The Steps is dressed to impress<br />
With a paisley bow-tie and handkerchief by the chest<br />
Do the clothes make the man, or the man make the clothes?<br />
Well, who knows? The man with the clothes gets the hos<br />
Oh, wow, ladies say &quot;ow&quot;, wipe your brow<br />
No regret, if you sweat, it's only right, 'cause that's how<br />
You're reacting to the music with the movement it calls for<br />
Young lady, let's dance and take a walk like it's bought for<br />
Ain't even gonna ask what you went to the mall for<br />
New shoes and new dress and tonight's what it's all for<br />
[Double K:] You got the P mixed with Time Machine<br />
[Comel:] Well, you know…<br />
[Double K:] And Shawn Jackson left me feeling clean<br />
[Comel:] Yeah, that's right<br />
We gonna party 'til the roof fall down<br />
And if you stay rockin' with us, that's proof y'all down<br />
<br />
[Comel:]<br />
And have to start with a razor, shape up and shave<br />
A starch sprayed iron board and some tequila<br />
A cummerbund? Sure, that's where I tuck the flask in<br />
Not inebriated, just walk with an <span class="grey-text">owl</span> limp<br />
I wish I had on roller skates, people would be laughing<br />
I'd be a dancing machine, twirling like a madman<br />
Stealing the silverware, both napkins, I don't care<br />
Epitome of &quot;you can't take him anywhere!&quot;<br />
Seconds, fifths, sixths, how much was that a plate? Aight.<br />
Let me smoke a cigarette, excuse for great escape<br />
Derelict aristocrat, you could call me some of that<br />
Truth be told, life of the party is where I fit in at<br />
Lindy hop, poodle embroidered on her dress<br />
Flipped her over my shoulder, we both landed in a split<br />
I knew <span class="grey-text">my game was</span> special 'cause I would even sweat her<br />
Money kept popping out places I didn't even expect<br />
And little cats leapt up like &quot;I wanna be like that!&quot;<br />
I said, &quot;Sit down, son, have you heard of Tuxedo Rap?&quot;<br />
It has to start with the praise, shape up and shave<br />
A starch spray, too young, so left out the tequila<br />
<br />
([Double K:] Get with it, everybody, let's up jump the break…<br />
[Rap sample:] Funky fresh, dressed to impress, ready to party<br />
[Thes One:] The People Under The Stairs… (repeated and scratched)<br />
<br />
[Double K:] It's the T!<br />
[Thes One:] Tremendous<br />
[Double K:] U!<br />
[Thes One:] Under the stairs<br />
[Double K:] X!<br />
[Thes One:] For the double-X ladies, right there<br />
[Double K:] E!<br />
[Thes One:] For the elegant styles you might see<br />
[Double K:] D-O!<br />
[Thes One:] For the dope that makes the Re-Mi!<br />
[Double K:] Girl!<br />
[Thes One:] She said she don't like rap music, don't make her dance<br />
Now, lookit here, lady, no debating, just take a chance<br />
Glance at Double K, he back, spinning Tuxedo Rap<br />
The people started clapping, but all they saw was my fingers snap<br />
Modern soul slide, high wire, white sock<br />
Penny loafer gleam, American dreamin' like SHA NA NA!<br />
The piranhas bite in the river, we deliver tight rhymes<br />
Stay cool like Klondike, the black and white<br />
Brown, yellow and red that sounds Better Than Ezra<br />
Two o' clock…?!? You forget what it says, bra!<br />
Party all night with your people, we're the P<br />
They're the Time Machine, and together, it's <span class="grey-text">mild</span> trilogy<br />
Nah, for real though, stop, dudes, man, yo, you're killing me<br />
That grown-man rap with underground sensibility<br />
So, Shawn Jackson, got your back one time<br />
Well, get on the mic with your master rhyme… Yo, SJ!<br />
<br />
[Shawn Jackson:]<br />
They say you got so hot, can you explain?<br />
It's basically the swagger I got, for you the bane<br />
'Cause if I'm gonna do it, I've gots ta' do my thing<br />
Make you bang it at the table like pops in Boomerang<br />
Don't be pussy-whipped with that pussy<br />
I whip that trick like DJ if you push me<br />
Parallel to my own life, hustle and flow<br />
Up in the show, peep the merch table, hustle and flow<br />
Spit drugs, couple hundred or mo'<br />
They say I'm too cocky, my response to it: &quot;Fuck it, I'll blow.&quot;<br />
Keep your formal with a tux and a rose<br />
In your truck, with a song that, turned to ten<br />
It might fuck witcha bros, '93 kids stuck in the zone<br />
Shocks you ain't rockin', Hilfiger buttoned-up, tucked in Girbauds<br />
You wanna see the freshest beings from this way<br />
It's the PUTS, the TM and SJ, yes! Yes!<br />
([Thes One:] Rockin' fo' sho')<br />
<br />
[Comel:] It's the T-U-X<br />
[Jaysonic:] Yes<br />
[Comel:] E-D-O<br />
[Jaysonic:] Let's go<br />
[Comel:] R-A-P<br />
[Jaysonic:] Let 'em know<br />
<br />
[All:] It's the T-U-X, Yes, E-D-O<br />
Let's go, R-A-P, let 'em know!<br />
