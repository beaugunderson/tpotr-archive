<h1>My Boy D</h1>
<p><strong>Written by: Michael Turner &amp; Christopher Portugal</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>[Spoken sample:] Now, we know that the first four letters in the word &quot;reality&quot; are &quot;real,&quot; okay? And it's getting serious… you know, that's keeping it real, you know what I'm saying?… And, at that time, gangsta rap was really <span class="grey-text">turning</span> into a game, so it was kinda like… nobody had no money from rap, nobody had no house on MTV Cribs, you hearing me?… Know what I mean, 'cause nobody had any money, it was more-or-less about money…<br />
<br />
[Double K:]<br />
The year was summer, 1972, young black male<br />
Graduated fresh out of high school, dreams of hitting college<br />
He heard about the parties and had a taste for knowledge<br />
But wasn't aware of fees, tuition, books, and housing<br />
Scholarships not rolling in, and Mama worked two jobs<br />
Daddy left home years ago, owed money to the mob<br />
So the boy went for dolo, and raised himself<br />
He took money from the wealthy, put it on his mama's shelf<br />
Anyway, he got a letter in the mail one day<br />
Thought it was his ticket, opened it, he was on his way<br />
But damn! No assistance from the government<br />
Looked out on his block, and thought about hugging it<br />
Heard a couple stories about this cat around the corner<br />
Who had a clean Brougham with diamond in the back<br />
Every time that brother rolled by, he tipped his hat<br />
He wanted that, if he couldn't hit the books<br />
Never in his black dreams did he think of being a crook<br />
But look, no jobs getting offered by the man<br />
He put a hole in his basketball and came up with another plan<br />
<br />
([&quot;D&quot; (Double K):] Yo, I'm not even playing, can you dig it? I'm about to go around the corner. I'mma talk to that man with that hat on, and I'mma get me some of that money out there 'cause I ain't even playing around, man. I'm trying to get some money, man!)<br />
<br />
[Both:] Said, my boy's D, got a white Cadillac<br />
Yeah, you can get it, but you're never coming back<br />
See, my boy's D, got a white Cadillac<br />
Sunroof, window tint, diamond in the back<br />
Yeah, my boy's D, he got a white Cadillac<br />
Yeah, you can get it, but you're never coming back<br />
Said, my boy's D, he got a white Cadillac<br />
Sunroof, window tint, diamond in the back<br />
<br />
[Thes One:]<br />
He's in and out of jails, in and out of bars<br />
Wood-trimmed county courtrooms and wood-trimmed cars<br />
It keeps him Hollywood Swinging in the shadows with the stars<br />
Eighty blocks from the studi-box, roll down the boulevard real slow<br />
The hustler making dough the Greyhound runaways<br />
A pocket full of cash flow, keep every last ho on astro on East Melrose<br />
The butterfly lapel and red rose and the Shirelles<br />
So he's always moving slow in the Coupe de Ville<br />
He got the six-shot revolver, he shoot to kill<br />
He gives the Abba-Zaba to the children living on his block<br />
He doesn't talk no talk, he just walks the walk<br />
And now one of them is going, and he wants to have his back<br />
Friday night, Soul Revue, he said let's meet at Maverick's Flat<br />
Got the booth in the back with the red telephone<br />
&quot;Young man, call your mama, tell her you ain't coming home&quot;<br />
The first task, hit on the flask, chisel the glass<br />
Welcome to the rest of your life, you're first, then you're last<br />
Now, let's go…<br />
([Drug dealer (Double K):] You take this, put it in your pocket, we gonna make some dough…)<br />
<br />
[Both:] Said, my boy's D, got a white Cadillac<br />
Yeah, you can get it, but you're never coming back<br />
See, my boy's D, got a white Cadillac<br />
Sunroof, window tint, diamond in the back<br />
Yeah, my boy's D, he got a white Cadillac<br />
Yeah, you can get it, but you're never coming back<br />
Said, my boy's D, he got a white Cadillac<br />
Sunroof, window tint, diamond in the back<br />
<br />
[Double K:]<br />
Now it's '79, we talking 'bout jail time<br />
Got caught up selling dust off in the county line<br />
He's having thoughts about the day he got that piece of mail<br />
Was looking to meet his professor, instead he had smack to sell<br />
Classic story, good brother gone bad<br />
Could've been a little rider, if only he had his dad<br />
It's kind of sad, but we all seen it plenty of times<br />
Especially if you niggas heard some Ice T rhymes<br />
([Spoken sample:] Word!)<br />
<br />
[Thes One:] Alright, man. Kay, are my bars up?<br />
[Double K:] Yeah, yeah, yeah, man. I got 'em, got 'em.<br />
[Thes One:] Alright, hold up, lemme see… Alright: &quot;Lyrical ma- ol' ma-&quot;… Aw, f- what the f-<br />
[Double K:] Ay-yo, yo, yo, yo, what's wrong with you, man?<br />
[Thes One:] Fucking… my teeth hurt, man! I don't know, what the fuck, dude?<br />
[Double K:] Yo, I think you might need to check that out, man.<br />
[Thes One:] For real?<br />
[Double K:]  Yeah, you might need to get that checked out, man. Can't be rapping with a fucked-up tooth.<br />
[Thes One:] Yeah, I guess you're right, man…</p>
