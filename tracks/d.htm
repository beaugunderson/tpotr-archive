<h1>D</h1>
<p><strong>Written by: Michael Turner &amp; Christopher Portugal</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>[DJ Dusk:]<br />
Okay, check it out, check it out. We about to flip the record and see what happens next… and uh, have lots of fun. I'm talking a little bit too much; I'm a little bit excited. I wanna see this go down, and if you wanna see this go down, make some noise…<br />
<br />
[Thes One:]<br />
In the corners of my mind<br />
Memories fall away, with no regard the time<br />
And every once in a while, they fall<br />
And I can smell the paint on the junior high wall<br />
The night KJLH DJed the dance<br />
My white cardigan and grey pants<br />
Huh, we did the damn running man<br />
My mind's taking me back again<br />
It's got me drifting, while I drive<br />
It's been about three years, since you were alive<br />
But your number's still in my cell phone, you know<br />
I just had a son, you'll never get to see grow, shit<br />
Conversation with the deceased<br />
The night <em>The Next Step</em> was released<br />
We talked, and I walked to the store, got a drink<br />
Got drunk alone and cried, scared of what y'all would think<br />
Damn... this is all I ever wanted<br />
It's tough moving forward, when the past keeps you haunted<br />
Like Metroid, blue lights, late-at-night Nintendo<br />
Half asleep, backseat, lights through the window<br />
Living in Limbo, somewhere between<br />
Right now and yesterday, feels like a bad dream<br />
The mundane memories are random and vivid<br />
Life's hard to believe, I lived it...<br />
<br />
[Sung sample:] No matter, no matter what the world may say<br />
[Thes One:] Right now is already the past<br />
Life moves on, but the memories last<br />
[Sung sample:] No matter, no matter what the world may say<br />
[Thes One:] And I can see it all so clear<br />
When I look back, tomorrow's never here<br />
<br />
[Double K:]<br />
See, I remember, not too long ago<br />
When we was getting tall, thirteen years old<br />
We had visions of being Second to None, but wearing the other color<br />
Remember when you brought your mom's gun, to school?<br />
Yeah, we was fools, but as friends, we was closer<br />
You loved Kool and the Gang, and my Ice T poster<br />
Bagging on teachers, banging in the hallways<br />
Watching videos and making raps on the off-days<br />
But years start to pass, and (man!) I don't know what it is<br />
Different friends, different influences<br />
We started smoking sherm, but I bailed out quick (fuck this shit!)<br />
After the third time, around '96<br />
You was working at <span class="grey-text">Fedco</span>, when you got called up<br />
Around the same time, Rahiem got shot up<br />
I noticed the change, and that shit was getting to you<br />
Along with everything else, man, you know I feel you<br />
I thought it was a phase, and in time, it might pass<br />
But you kept on loc'in', tried to kick Dre's ass<br />
Yep, we had it gassed until them ese's pulled out<br />
(What the deal, homes?)<br />
I think about it all the time, glad we made it out<br />
But the next time I called, moms didn't sound right<br />
Said something about a robbery, and 15 to life (damn!)<br />
Sometimes I feel guilty, and sometimes I don't<br />
Niggas choose they own lanes, and do other things to cope<br />
It might sound corny, but I'm saying one love<br />
I remember the laughs until the time we crossed paths<br />
<br />
[Sung sample:] No matter, no matter what the world may say<br />
[Double K:] The memory remains<br />
Fresh on my mind, like it happened today<br />
[Sung sample:] No matter, no matter what the world may say<br />
[Double K:] And I'mma just ride on<br />
Time ain't forever, dig the words of the song<br />
[Sung sample:] No matter, no matter what the world may say<br />
[Thes One:]If tomorrow never comes, I'm fine<br />
Plenty of things to do inside my mind<br />
[Sung sample:] No matter, no matter what the world may say<br />
[Thes One:]And I can see it all so clear<br />
When I look back, tomorrow's never here</p>
