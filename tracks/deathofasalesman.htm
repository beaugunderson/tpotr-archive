<h1>Death Of A Salesman</h1>
<p><strong>Written by: Michael Turner &amp; Christopher Portugal</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>[Spanish sample:] <span class="grey-text">(?)</span><br />
<br />
[Rap sample:] You wack MCs is dead MCs. You wack MCs is dead…<br />
<br />
[Double K:]<br />
Yo, I was chilling, lamping, cooling at the spot<br />
When this light-skinned nigga with Tims told me he could rock<br />
He told me his name and I think it started with a K<br />
That's exactly what happened after this day<br />
I put that same letter after his name to end it off<br />
So I <span class="grey-text">coughed gave threw</span> a pound and then I was off<br />
Went around the corner where the homies was at<br />
Told my nigga, <span class="grey-text">Elad, pull</span> went down, he handed me the...<br />
Took about five pulls, yo, that shit was just right<br />
He handed me about five Newports and I was off into the night<br />
Stopped at the store and picked up a Big Gulp<br />
When I saw this black Jeep pull up, it was my homie from the set<br />
He told me <span class="grey-text">heard from evil</span> went down, so I hopped inside the loc<br />
So we could head across town<br />
<br />
[Double K:] Yo yo yo… Hey, Thes<br />
[Thes One:] What's up, man? What's up?<br />
[Double K:] We're bumpin' at Unity tonight, man… I'll just go in there and do this thing, ain't no need to stay…<br />
[Thes One:] Let's be out.<br />
<br />
[Double K:]<br />
Stepped inside the place, stepped quiet as fuck<br />
Stepped into a dark corner so fools wouldn't know what's up<br />
Thes came over, said he saw him at the bar fronting like he was hard<br />
But it was time to pull his card, so I stepped to this nigga<br />
Look him dead in his face, was like &quot;You's a disgrace to this race!&quot;<br />
Then I…<br />
[gunshots/screaming]<br />
[Rap samples:]Wack MCs… wack MCs… (etc.)<br />
Make me have to call your name out… (scratched and repeated)<br />
<br />
[Thes One:]<br />
It was a cold September morning, there was fog in the air<br />
A pair of police proceeded ahead of a 21-car black caravan<br />
Of cars and vans with headlights, <span class="grey-text">testimony</span> of dead night<br />
My flashlight light the right way for me<br />
I went early and climbed a tree, so I might see the show as it passed<br />
The cars slow as they pass the PD-blocked intersection<br />
Then gassed up the hill through the gate on the left<br />
And slowed and showed moonlight reflections on the fresh-mown grass<br />
Tombstones on tinted glass<br />
The special pass sitting on the dashboard of a black Ford<br />
In front stopped the cop and he opened the door<br />
And out steps a man with flowers inside his grip<br />
<span class="grey-text">Squinting</span> for the pig, <span class="grey-text">Linden</span> suit and wingtips.<br />
Out flew the rest and they rared to go, I hear no sounds,<br />
Just see lips moving and moonglow, so I and I, camouflaged<br />
Slide down the tree, float across the road that's like 30 feet wide<br />
Beverly-Hills-style glide past the G-ride<br />
See a rock at the end of the block, cop a squat<br />
And watch men slide, an all-black box with gold rails<br />
<span class="grey-text">Tail-side</span>, adorned with carnations in random configurations<br />
Of player pride and herring bone, scales and other paraphernalia<br />
Of a lifestyle that <span class="grey-text">reflected but failure</span><br />
The trails of fog leap of the back of the cab, passed it one-by-one<br />
Dookie gold made it hard to hold<br />
I had to laugh. Oh, what fun when one dies<br />
They walked toward the grave, the fog started to rise<br />
Check the coffin… &quot;hella tight&quot;… put it on the hoist<br />
And lower it deep, deeper into the moist earth<br />
Last words of this man… I slipped into the night<br />
And <span class="grey-text">heard the</span> fog…&quot;Nigga had a hella tight car <span class="grey-text">(?)</span><br />
<br />
<span class="grey-text">We're dead nigga… He dead… (?)</span></p>
