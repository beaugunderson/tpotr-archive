<h1>Yo</h1>
<p><strong>Written by: Michael Turner &amp; Christopher Portugal</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>[Double K:] Uh uh… let's take 'em out of, uh… b-boy experience… Thes One, how ya-<br />
[Thes One:] What's up?<br />
[Double K:] Um, Thes One, man…<br />
[Thes One:] What's up?<br />
[Double K:] How ya like me now?<br />
[Thes One:] Well, Double K, check it out, how ya like me now?<br />
[Double K:] I don't know, Thes One, how ya like me now?<br />
[Thes One:] Ay-yo, my mellow Double K, how ya like me now?<br />
[Double K:] Well, I don't know, Thes One, how ya like me now?<br />
[Thes One:] Huh huh, yo, Double K, how ya like me now?<br />
[Double K:] Yo, everybody, how ya like us now?<br />
[Thes One:] 'Cause all you sucka perpetrators hate our serious sound, but Double K…<br />
[Double K:] Well, I don't know, how ya like me now?<br />
[Thes One:] Ha ha, yo, I don't know, how ya like us now?<br />
[Double K:] I don't know, Thes One, how ya like me now?<br />
[Thes One:] Yeah, man, I know that motherfucker Thes… yo, check it out, man…<br />
[Double K:] How ya like me now?<br />
[Thes One:] How you like us now?<br />
<br />
[Thes One:] (Ay-yo…)<br />
<span class="grey-text">Eyes</span> stay so cool, he freeze colosseums<br />
Man, the kid shine so bright, you sneeze when you see him<br />
He still hasn't changed, trading records for per diem<br />
Guaranteeing new editions to his wax museum<br />
Man, I've seen it, his collection grows, it's quite incredible<br />
Hunting down them records like the damn things were edible<br />
In this context, he's too complex, you're oedipal<br />
Y'all motherfuckers only produce poetical perfection<br />
And hypothetical selections for your general public<br />
Expecting a soft subject<br />
Man, it's medical touch, not budget, but worth it<br />
Impregnates the track, jump back, and then birth it<br />
Word is born, now his word plays all day<br />
At that fancy day care over by UCLA<br />
While he sits at home, making beats, drinking the Heine<br />
Putting new breaks on drum pads like Meineke<br />
I finally seen him one day, chilling with his group<br />
He was eating at El Cholo, sipping tortilla soup<br />
I said, &quot;Thes, yo, I'm feeling all them old jazz loops<br />
Can you make me up a track, man? I got a little loot&quot;<br />
He said, &quot;Thanks, but don't thank me, thank the forefathers<br />
They deserve the credit, now they's nobody bothers&quot;<br />
I paused, I said, &quot;True&quot;, he took a sip of his stew<br />
He said, &quot;I'll dig you up a beat like Super Mario 2&quot;<br />
I was like &quot;Word, dude, I'll pick up the check&quot;, he's like, &quot;Don't bother<br />
Pull up a chair, I'll introduce you to my partner&quot;<br />
<br />
[Double K:]<br />
Ready, set, go, this man's a vet pro<br />
Call him humble, call him psycho, his mother calls him Michael<br />
He might go loco if you fake and perpetrate<br />
<span class="grey-text">And tricking off in fresh hate and you can see the best play in a feel</span><br />
Look, he's real and ill, what a combination<br />
Seen him signing up soldiers to start his new rap nation<br />
He said time was wasting, and I could see it in his eyes<br />
He was fed up with the politics, wack beats, and lies<br />
Heard a lady say, &quot;Sock it to me!&quot;, and brothas was pumping they fist<br />
On some Reverend Al Sharp-shit, better now than not to talk shit<br />
He walking it like them DUI games<br />
Mind frame in revolution and you know he got solutions<br />
Not worried about pollution, afraid for his art form<br />
Matter of fact, he's kinda shook up, his people want to hook up<br />
His people better look up 'cause it's about to go down<br />
Like the brew when the night's over and never sober<br />
When he is, he's kinda mean, loves his hi-hats clean<br />
Stays on the fly rap scene, he's a fighter and a lover<br />
Reminds me of Danny Glover, telling y'all it ain't no other<br />
He don't spit hot bars, him and his friends hop bars<br />
Personality: rockstar slash mack-tivist<br />
After this, I'm gonna sit and think about what I learned<br />
I can still hear his voice and smell the Buddha he burned<br />
He said, &quot;Earn respect, learn to respect, and you'll succeed&quot;<br />
True indeed, then I gave him a pound<br />
He said he'd break it down and sell it (homie!)<br />
How ya like him now?<br />
<br />
[Double K:] How you like him too? 'Cause that's the homie, fo' sho'<br />
Thes One and… (Double!) Yeah, hah! (Get it!)<br />
Well, uh… well, alright, y'all… and go back?<br />
I'm always <span class="grey-text">popping</span>… go back though? Woo!<br />
Uh, go back though? Go back though…<br />
Huh, tobacco? Let's go back though…<br />
Hey, c'mon, man. What you doing, man?<br />
You playing with my emotions right now, man<br />
C'mon, man, what you doing?<br />
I know you wanna push that button…<br />
I know you wanna push that button… c'mon, brotha…</p>
