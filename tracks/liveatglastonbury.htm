Uh, rock rock, y'all, you don't stop y'all<br />

<br />
[Double K, backed up by Thes One and JazMak:]<br />
Check this shit out… ay-yo… ay-yo…<br />
Going <span class="grey-text">wack-ass shine like a dreads</span><br />
Wear hella pearls, gather black silk, proceed to rock grills <br />
Like Sheneneh (Who that, y'all?)<br />
Man, it's KK, straight from West L.A., pro-black like KDAY (What?)<br />
The Crescent Heights B-Boy, known for the destroy<br />
Up for the down stroke, loc, don't provoke<br />
You's a joke, and I'm laughing like, &quot;Ha ha ha ha!&quot;<br />
And when your song comes on, I'm like, &quot;Ha ha ha ha!&quot;<br />
These niggas need to step back like, &quot;Excuse me, miss.&quot;<br />
And that dude who made your beats is going on my shitlist<br />
For faking, perpetrating, like nobody don't know<br />
But I inspect like the rebel… Thes, turn up the treble<br />
<br />[All:] One two, y'all, you don't stop, y'all<br />
Said-a get your back off the wall, y'all<br />

Ay-yo, everyone's an MC (Fool, I know that!)<br />
Ay-yo, I just do my best to make my shit fat<br />
Like digging in the crates every day of the month<br />
Step back when I pull out my wax, blow dust<br />
Track so fresh heads can feel what we bring<br />
Gets all up in your head, in your spot like nicotine<br />
<span class="grey-text">Referee teens to life, jerrily</span><br />
We like to hip-hop on the mic, but not tonight, aight?<br />
So, if you all came to fight, you need to take it outside<br />
While I'm on the topic, yo, I'd like to say brown pride<br />
And if I have to hoo-ride on the mic, then I'll do ya<br />
MCs get <span class="grey-text">N-O hot oh, yo, like to ya</span><br />
And so on and so forth, here, crack a beer<br />
I'm already on my fourth, and I'm going for more<br />
To all y'all on the floor, get away from the door<br />
I got a couple gifts for you that I bought at the store<br />
<br />
[Double K:] Hey, what you bring with you tonight, homeboy?<br />
[Thes One:] I ain't got nothing!<br />
[Double K:] Well then, fuck it! Just tell me what you're not!<br />
<br />
[Thes One, backed up by Double K and JazMak:]<br />
I'm not a major-label MC with a big gold chain<br />
I'm not scientifical, fronting like I got brains<br />
I'm not a drug dealer, a movie actor<br />
Or a new-jack ofay with a rich benefactor<br />
