<h1>LA Nights</h1> 
<p><strong>Written by: Michael Turner &amp; Christopher Portugal</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>[Dolla Bill:] WRLA, 55 minutes after the hour... <span class="grey-text">sending</span> you out into the LA night, be safe and sound. May you have green lights out there in the LA night all the way. Dolla Bill, your hip hop MC, reminding you as you uh... pull some of that funk outta your trunk, while you dig the Thes One and Double K... hip hop beat breakdown!<br />
([Rap sample:] It's Friday night...<br />
[Rap sample:] ...on the streets of L.A.<br />
[Rap sample:] It's Friday night...<br />
[Rap sample:] ...on the streets of L.A.<br />
...on the streets of L.A.)<br />
<br />
[Double K:]<br />
Homies on the corner, doin' the boogaloo<br />
Feelin' the crisp breeze, blowin' loud on trees<br />
Watchin' the cars pass, lookin' as the sun creeps<br />
Lower into the ocean, the city's in motion<br />
On La Cienega, the limos stretch up Sunset<br />
Talkin' loud on your handset, stuck in the traffic<br />
Or hangin' on the porch with your buddies, gettin' ill<br />
The West Side the best side, we know how to chill<br />
Or hittin' up the beach, yo, it's better at night<br />
The stars shine bright, the vibe is just right<br />
Or pullin' out that Cutlass to dip down the ave<br />
Got the moonroof open with the funk on blast<br />
And honkin' at the dames to the left of your lane<br />
It's a night in Los Angeles, no need to complain<br />
We on a campaign, and we doin' it right<br />
Live from Crescent Heights, it's an L.A. night, now let's go...<br />
<br />
[Sung sample:] L.A. night... don't you wanna treat it right?<br />
[Rap sample:] I'm goin' out...<br />
[Rap sample:] ...on the streets of L.A.<br />
[Sung sample:] L.A. night... don't you wanna treat it right?<br />
[Rap sample:] So if you wanna roll...<br />
[Rap sample:] ...on the streets of L.A.<br />
[Sung sample:] L.A. night... don't you wanna treat it right?<br />
[Rap sample:] I'm goin' out...<br />
[Rap sample:] ...on the streets of L.A.<br />
[Sung sample:] L.A. night... don't you wanna treat it right?<br />
[Rap sample:] I'm goin' out...<br />
[Rap sample:] I'll be there in a jiffy<br />
<br />
[Thes One:]<br />
The sun is goin' down over the 110<br />
Goin' out with your lady or just hangin' with your friends<br />
The city of L.A. comes alive at night<br />
When lights turn on, we don our best bespoke and backstroke<br />
On the freeway, headed to this side or that side<br />
That's why Los Angelenos take pride in a clean ride<br />
The brake lights reflect off of the windshield<br />
You valet at the Chalet, early shopping at the Westfield<br />
You gotta look proper, L.A. night, they won't let you in<br />
Whether you're rooftop standin' or at the Edison<br />
Underground city nightlife has many layers<br />
From bachelorette parties, tourists, to local players<br />
They all stars at the bars, but for one night only<br />
'Cause every Los Angeles night is a story for old homies<br />
And dive bars low-key, West Side Karaoke<br />
South Side smokin' the holy ghost on the porch, we call the coolout<br />
In junior high, we called that shit a kickback<br />
Or reminisce on L.A. nights, pass and drink a six-pack<br />
And Avenue A to Redondo, watchin' the sunset<br />
'Cause L.A. gives you nights that you never forget<br />
It's L.A....<br />
<br />
[Sung sample:] L.A. night... don't you wanna treat it right?<br />
[Rap sample:] I'm goin' out... (Party!)<br />
[Rap sample:] ...on the streets of L.A.<br />
[Sung sample:] L.A. night... don't you wanna treat it right?<br />
[Rap sample:] That's what it's all about!<br />
[Rap sample:] ...on the streets of L.A.<br />
[Sung sample:] L.A. night... don't you wanna treat it right?<br />
[Rap sample:] I'm goin' out... (Party!)<br />
[Rap sample:] ...on the streets of L.A.<br />
[Sung sample:] L.A. night... don't you wanna treat it right?<br />
[Rap sample:] I'm goin' out...<br />
[Rap sample:] So throw on some locs, a silk shirt, and some dickies<br />
<br />
[Sung sample:] L.A., L.A. [repeats]<br />
<br />
([Double K:] Ooooh, shit. What's up, my nigga?<br />
[Double K, slowed down:] Yeah, man...<br />
[Thes One:] What's up, man?<br />
[Partygoer #1:] What's happenin', baby?<br />
[Double K:] I just got here, man. Why didn't you save me something to eat, man?<br />
[Double K, slowed down:] Aw shit... hey, man, look at what this nigga got on right here, man... Oh, oh... Hey, nice chain, my dude... Man, one of these niggas smell like <span class="grey-text">earring back</span>, you know what I'm sayin'? Hee hee...<br />
[Partygoer #2:] Yo, man, you gonna burn off my 'fro!<br />
[Double K, slowed down:] Yeah... Yo, yo, don't burn his 'fro off, man. He been growin' that shit for, like, two months, man.<br />
[Thes One, slowed down:] Naw, man... ain't no gangbangin' over here. Just chill out, man.<br />
[Partygoer #3:] ...positive vibe.<br />
[Double K, slowed down:] Yo, lemme get a piece of chicken. I can't get no chicken? But yo, you cool anyway, man. Word...
[Thes One:] Ay-yo, does Ralphie still work, man?<br />
[Double K:] Ra- yo, he works, man... no, he doesn't work, man. He broke his arm, dude...<br />
[Sung sample:] California knows how to party...<br />
[Double K:] He's dead, man...<br />
[Partygoer #4:] He's dead?<br />
[Sung sample:] California knows how to party... [slows down]<br />
<br />
[Spoken sample:] Party... when we get together and do our thing. Hipping many cats to where it's at.<br />
[Spoken sample:] Sweet and cool.<br />
[Spoken sample:] Funky!<br />
[Spoken sample:] Yeah... The record ends and we must begin again.<br />
[Spoken sample:] Let the good times roll, the good times roll...<br />
[Spoken sample:] Party...<br />
[Spoken sample:] They're so hip... and all that shit.<br />
[Spoken sample:] Y'all better get hip [repeated and scratched]<br />
Y'all better get hip and come off this trip [echoes]</p>
