<h1>Days Like These</h1>
<p><strong>Written by: Michael Turner &amp; Christopher Portugal</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>[Double K:] Yo… this for our loved ones… this for our loved ones… your family, your friends… and all the ones that you trust… for my mama, for Thes' mama… for my pops and his pops… this for you… uh huh…<br />
<br />
[Double K:]<br />
Growing up in the eighties, I been thinking 'bout it lately<br />
Was a lot that I missed, I was a star upon a wish<br />
You know, my pops, he didn't stay around too long<br />
He was hanging in the studio, making them songs<br />
And my mother was young and still sprung on life<br />
I used to watch Different Strokes, I wanted that for Mike<br />
The Jeffersons was a family, I dug it the most<br />
Black folks trying to make it, to y'all, here's a toast<br />
I used to go to school with my Moms on the bus<br />
Downtown, so she can get a degree and feed me<br />
And my sister, man, I can't thank her enough<br />
She used to get high, and she stopped for us<br />
We used to walk to the grocery store<br />
And if my mother didn't have the money, we was at my Grandma's door<br />
God bless her life, and God bless her soul<br />
That old lady showed me love that no one will ever know<br />
Yeah, I wanted Transformers and them fresh turntables<br />
And really didn't understand, when they wasn't able<br />
They had bills to pay, taking nickels from a dime<br />
I just waited for my birthday and Christmastime<br />
Now, those are days that pass and me and Chris write rhymes<br />
And until my last Swisher, I'mma drop these lines<br />
I love the women in my life, they kept me alive<br />
And now, I gotta keep myself alive…<br />
<br />
You see, the things that you lose'll be the things ([Both:] you miss)<br />
And no one can prepare you for the days (like this)<br />
You can have a (lost one), you can lose a (loved one)<br />
Be thankful for what you got, and everybody (have fun!)<br />
The things you lose'll be the things (you miss)<br />
And no one can prepare you for the days (like this)<br />
You can have a (lost one), you can lose a (loved one)<br />
Be thankful for what you got, everybody (have fun!)<br />
<br />
[Thes One:] (Check it out…)<br />
I got my music right here, my man right there, my family over there<br />
And everywhere, I know you're out there, I wake up<br />
Blessed with another day to make the whereabouts better, give it up<br />
Higher power, live it up, we grown now<br />
At the table, play the hand that we been dealt<br />
With no choice, you ante up, all your chips up on the felt<br />
And when the only thing that's left is faith<br />
You maintain, the last defense against pain<br />
I wish we could stop the thing eating Grandpa's brain<br />
But all the same who could I blame, and how could I complain?<br />
We made it off the plane on September 10th<br />
July 3rd, I live to pay another month of rent, been getting bent on guilt<br />
The homie disappeared, I hope he's not killed<br />
He could never know, how my flow he had helped build<br />
How my dad sacrificed in the field, picking fruit<br />
So his only son could grow up digging loops<br />
Man, it's mad deep, losing sleep for lost souls and brethren<br />
For all my stillborn kin, I live for you, and then some<br />
Eugenio, you know we wouldn't let you go that easily<br />
This family tree's a redwood, the roots are unreasonably tough<br />
As the men in my life, I love you much, thank you<br />
And I ([Rap sample:] represent), everyday I give it up…<br />
<br />
'Cause the things you lose could be the things (you miss)<br />
And no one can prepare you for the days (like this)<br />
You can have a (lost one), you can lose a (loved one)<br />
Be thankful for what you got, and everybody (have fun!)<br />
Yo, the things you lose could be the things (you miss)<br />
No one can prepare you for the days (like this)<br />
You can have a (lost one), you can lose a (loved one)<br />
Be thankful for what you got, and everybody (have fun!)<br />
<br />
[Rap sample:] Have fun! (repeated and scratched)<br />
Have fun, y'all, have fun, c'mon!<br />
Have fun, y'all, let's have fun!<br />
C'mon, let's have fun, y'all!<br />
We have fun…<br />
[Double K:] Let's have fun!<br />
And everybody, have fun… have fun!<br />
<br />
[Rap sample:] We have…<br />
[Rap sample:] …have fun! (repeated and scratched)<br />
<br />
[Rap sample:] Represent…<br />
[Rap sample:] As a kid, think-a shit like that's mad deep…</p>
