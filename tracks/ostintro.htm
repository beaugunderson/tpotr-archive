<h1>Intro <font size="1"><strong>(&quot;O.S.T.&quot;)</strong></font></h1> 
<p><strong>Written by: Michael Turner &amp; Christopher Portugal</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>[Spoken sample:] Back in the studio… (scratched)<br />
<br />
([Soulful vocals in background])<br />
[Man #1:] Are you on dope?<br />
[Man #2:] Yes.<br />
[Man #1:] What kind?<br />
[Man #2:] Musical dope.<br />
[Man #1:] You get high?<br />
[Man #2:] Yes.<br />
[Man #1:] Offa' what?<br />
[Man #2:] Music.<br />
[Man #1:] Are you on a trip or something?<br />
[Man #2:] Yes.<br />
[Man #1:] What kind of a trip?<br />
[Man #2:] Music…<br />
([Soulful vocals sample:] Life!)<br />
<br />
[Thes One:]<br />
The People Under The Stairs are back with the win<br />
All city called in, touring like a Grizwold<br />
Made it back safe, made the track laced tasty<br />
Scoped out your album and the time that you waste, G<br />
I'm hasty, your keyboard tracks, they don't phase me<br />
Digging through the crates for some gems that amaze me<br />
<span class="grey-text">A musical</span> represent, my LA environment<br />
Porch sitting, beat making, writing rhymes, getting bent<br />
Took the time to combine, me and big Mike rhyme<br />
Make our own beats, <span class="grey-text">fill</span> the streets with the lifeline<br />
Lifelong, through the <span class="grey-text">strife</span> times, I'mma write songs<br />
Three albums deep and couldn't stop if I had a<br />
Calmness with this, my life drama, end quote<br />
I used to be a fan, but <span class="grey-text">with</span> time, I lost hope<br />
So I took the problem in my own hands<br />
Now I'm looking through the scope<br />
With the musical dope, to please fans<br />
<br />
[Double K:]<br />
It goes on-once again, original styles, taking the top of the pile<br />
Known for moving, controlling your crowd<br />
Double K to skeeze, please, and still loving the beats<br />
Still claiming the streets, still trying to eat<br />
Still high off my feet, do my digging discreet<br />
The Boss Angeles champ, worldwide like a stamp<br />
Can't nobody tell me nothing, I was born raising hell<br />
Bumped the funk straight from heaven, Michael '77<br />
And niggas still can't believe that we came right back<br />
Took a commercial break, we here to bring your fate<br />
On black vinyl, it's final, like the week before vacation<br />
Beating niggas at their own game, state their occupation<br />
So go home and tell your parents you won't need that equipment<br />
You need to cop assistance, your buddy was a witness<br />
The P-U-Thrash-Suckers like a mosh pit gang<br />
For always and always, the things'll never be the same<br />
<br />
[Thes One:]<br />
Only SomeTimes, Overly Stand Trying<br />
Okay, Start That Over, Send Track On Similar Transplant<br />
Over Sound That Operate Similar Towns<br />
Opt State To Other State On Sampling Templates<br />
Only SomeTimes Over Stand Frying<br />
Okay, Start That Over, Send Track On Similar Transplant<br />
Over Sound To Operate Similar Towns<br />
Opt State To Other State, Sample In Templates<br />
<br />
[Double K:]<br />
Turn this in, perfection unit, track schooling<br />
Call us &quot;max cool&quot; and we be hip hop <span class="grey-text">ruling</span><br />
Original stash taking, non-faking, not to be mistaken as anything nice<br />
(Yo, we like cancer to your life!)<br />
That's so precious and young, but we wicked and old<br />
Tore up plenty of shows, let the story be told<br />
Yo we scolding-ing down niggas since the last time out<br />
Stepping up inside the booth, lashing out with the truth<br />
Prophets of another kind, keep it real on the mind<br />
With the hustle to the grind, this music of mine<br />
Niggas who try to call out, no doubt get hauled out<br />
Bawled out, wrong route, bet I hope you get stalled out<br />
The P be the bully of this so-called rap game<br />
More like a crap game, with no money to claim<br />
Ask who took it, yo, I got it and ain't giving it back<br />
You're living with that, so Thes One deliver 'em that… what?!<br />
<br />
[Thes One:]<br />
It's like a new-born baby, unseen sound, so hold it<br />
I worked too damn hard for you to fucking download it<br />
We been in the lab, all summer, hundred degrees<br />
Making beats, laying in eight-tracks, you know the steez<br />
Like scrounging up the pennies for the ice cream truck<br />
Get a couple extra bucks and go off looking for funk<br />
So basically there's nothing changed since the last time we talked<br />
Couple more crates, more house parties, hanging on the block<br />
Food spots and jokes, the 40 ounce and smokes<br />
We got a little more fame, basically the same blokes<br />
So all the real P fans, this goes out to you<br />
In whatever city you at, whoever your crew<br />
[Both:] So all the real P fans, this goes out to you<br />
In whatever city you at, whoever your crew<br />
[Thes One:] So all the real P fans, gather 'round and take note<br />
Presenting &quot;O.S.T.&quot;, the musical dope</p>

<ul><li>Taking the first letters of almost every word in Thes One's second verse essentially gives you something close to O.S.T.O.S.T.O.S.T... etc.</li></ul>
