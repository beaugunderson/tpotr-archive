<h1>Reflections (feat. Odell)</h1>
<p><strong>Written by: Michael Turner, Christopher Portugal &amp; Odell Johnson</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>[Odell:] <span class="grey-text">Now on me</span>…<br />
<br />
[Odell:]<br />
Jah sun has come, and I'm on the rise<br />
To face a day that's full of trials<br />
It's seems some way, we'll move on t'rough<br />
Give thanks and praise, it is with you, saying<br />
We're travelling on a thin, thin line<br />
Some walking around as if they're half blind, yeah<br />
Seems like struggles come their way<br />
And they start to war instead of pray<br />
<br />
[Odell:] Give him love! Lord…<br />
[Thes One &amp; Double K:] You got to give it up<br />
And you got to give it up<br />
And you got to give it up now…<br />
[Odell:] Give him love!<br />
[Thes One &amp; Double K:] You got to give it up<br />
And you got to give it up<br />
I said got to give it up now…<br />
([Thes One:] Uh, give it up…)<br />
<br />
[Odell:]<br />
The night has come and we want to play<br />
Yet it seems like we won't unite same way<br />
They standing in the blinding light<br />
Searching for a little light, yeah<br />
Holding on to <span class="grey-text">celebrate</span><br />
But they're losing, they're losing face, lord<br />
They say they want to stand up strong<br />
And yet they question &quot;Oh Lord, how long?&quot;<br />
<br />
[Odell:] Said, give him love… Lord, lord, yeah…<br />
[Thes One &amp; Double K:] You got to give it up<br />
I said got to give it up<br />
And you got to give it up now…<br />
[Odell:] I said give him love!<br />
[Thes One &amp; Double K:] I said got to give it up<br />
You just got to give it up<br />
I said got to give it up now…<br />
[Odell:] Said, give him love… Love, love, love, love, lord…<br />
[Thes One &amp; Double K:] You just got to give it up<br />
I said got to give it up<br />
I said got to give it up now…<br />
[Odell:] Give him love! Rasta love…<br />
[Thes One &amp; Double K:] You got to give it up<br />
I said got to give it up<br />
And you got to give it up now…<br />
<br />
[Double K:] (<span class="grey-text">Ready to pump</span>… huh…)<br />
So many times, the way that we were brought up<br />
Can have us in a mind state of steady getting caught up<br />
Wanting to follow and keep up with the trends<br />
Young girls having sex to impress their friends<br />
Insecurities can have a person living at their worst<br />
Instead of taking time out to think, they battle and curse<br />
Refuse the love giving, living a life of sinning<br />
In a whirlwind, spinning with confusion, you're losing<br />
Drinking, drug abusing, they called it the blues<br />
And we call it &quot;rock and rolling&quot; while losing mind control<br />
Self-control on cruise, see &quot;fuck it&quot; ain't the answer<br />
And if it was, a lot of people would breathe today<br />
Like Donny Hathaway and Marvin Gaye<br />
Miss Billie Holiday and my grandma Jean<br />
Who's smiling down on me 'cause I'm living my dream<br />
I'll keep a prayer in my mind, if I knew what I mean<br />
<br />
[Thes One:]<br />
I feel like the revolution's already here, it's just a matter of<br />
Whether you can hear or don't hear, some choose the latter<br />
Love the ignorant bliss and dismiss any matter<br />
That would cause contemplating these facts, and even sadder is<br />
They try and make it all black and white, it's complicated<br />
But the bottom line is freeing your mind is always hated<br />
Money and drug dealing are keeping us separated<br />
The more we look like animals, the more we get paraded<br />
Celebrated their system, ignoring something inside<br />
Like identifying with your family, culture, and pride<br />
You can't sell that inside a Wal-Mart<br />
They call art &quot;My Humps&quot;, but meanwhile, brothas cocking the pump<br />
Protecting the block, a child walks, ducking the shots<br />
They selling up rocks, the buck stops once at the top<br />
And speaking of, I know shove is coming to push, but dude<br />
You'd shoot me and wouldn't shoot George Bush!<br />
<br />
[Odell:] Hey, no fussing and fighting in a righteous land<br />
No fussing and fighting with your people's <span class="grey-text">plan</span><br />
No fussing and fighting, we know the Motherland<br />
No fussing and fighting…<br />
[Double K:] Listen!<br />
[Odell:] No man stand up strong… give him love…<br />
[Double K:] You can't be arrogant and conscious<br />
[Thes One:] You got to give it up<br />
[Double K:] Ay-yo, you can't be arrogant and conscious<br />
[Thes One:] Nope, you got to give it up<br />
[Double K:] I said, you can't be arrogant and conscious<br />
([Odell:] Rasta love…)<br />
[Thes One:] Yup, you got to give it up<br />
[Double K:] Man, it doesn't work<br />
[Thes One:] Nope.<br />
[Double K:] Man, it doesn't work<br />
[Thes One:] Huh.<br />
[Double K:] You can't be arrogant and conscious<br />
([Odell:] Give him love… Yeah… yeah…)<br />
[Thes One:] Yup, you got to give it up<br />
[Double K:] Look, you can't be arrogant and conscious<br />
[Thes One:] Yeah, you got to give it up<br />
([Odell:] Give him love…)<br />
[Double K:] You can't be arrogant and conscious<br />
[Thes One:] You got to give it up<br />
[Double K:] It doesn't work, nope, it doesn't work<br />
[Odell:] Just give him love… love, love, love, love, love…<br />
[Double K:] Listen! Need love… yes…<br />
[Odell:] Just give him… just give him, just give him, just give him… yeah…<br />
[Double K:] Listen, man… yo…<br />
<br />
[Odell:] Thes One and Double K… <span class="grey-text">roots racking</span>… in a hip-hop styley<br />
[Sung sample:] Music!<br />
[Odell:] It's all reggae to me…</p>
