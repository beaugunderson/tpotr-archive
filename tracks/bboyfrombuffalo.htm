<h1>Rick James, The B-Boy From Buffalo</h1> 
<p><strong>Written by: Michael Turner &amp; Christopher Portugal</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>[Rap sample, scratched:] Back, I'm about to begin…<br />
<br />
[Rick James (Double K):] Oh, hello. I'm Rick James, and if you love hip hop like I love hip hop, then I think you'd enjoy this brand new CD that I'm puttin' out. I got over 30 hip hop tunes that I covered on there, ranging from LL Cool J to Run DMC. Block-rockin', shell-shockin' hip hop beats for all you hip pops. Listen…<br />
<br />
[Announcer (Thes One):] The sensual sounds of Showbiz and AG…<br />
<br />
[Rick James:] All I see is blinkin' lights, track boards and fat mics<br />
950s, SP-12s, MPC 60s<br />
Shit is thumpin', ear drums pumpin'<br />
The shit is down tight 'cause the sample is tight<br />
Next level…<br />
<br />
[Announcer:] Who could forget Oakland's own Souls of Mischief…<br />
<br />
[Rick James:] Dialed the seven digits<br />
Call up Bridget, her man's a midget (Hello.)<br />
Plus she got friends, so I can dig it<br />
Now, that's the fattest stog I've ever seen (Wow!)<br />
Like Maui Waui, feel the good vibrations<br />
So many females, so many inspirations<br />
93 'Til…<br />
Hieroglyphics and the Stone City Band…<br />
<br />
Rick James, The B-Boy From Buffalo!<br />
<br />
[Announcer:] Here, Rick James takes a trip to Brooklyn…<br />
[Rick James:] (Microphone check, one-two, what is this?)<br />
Five carloads deep, gettin' ready to roll to a show (Yup.)<br />
Yo, we got massive crew, and I'm ready to go (Let's go.)<br />
So I grab my gear, hop in the whip and ride<br />
Stone City got the fly dope system inside<br />
Chaos…<br />
<br />
[Rap sample:] And we shall return!<br />
<br />
[Rick James:] Yeah, I like that… And you know, I come from Buffalo, and you know, up there, we listen to punk-funk, but I heard these guys, Run DMC, down in the city with this tape, and I liked it, and I think that's what prompted me to come in here and make this music for everybody, and redo it… put some punk-funk on it… make it sound like it's from Buffalo! You know… I really got into The Pharcyde, too, but uh… I wanna play this other song that I did by Slick Rick and Doug E. Fresh… ay, what's that called, &quot;The Show&quot; or some shit?<br />
<br />
[Rick James:] La di, da di… la di, da di… la di… da di…<br />
(Get this shit over with…)<br />
You know what? Yo, peep this…<br />
La di, da di, we likes to party<br />
We don't 'cause trouble, we don't bother nobody here<br />
I'm just a man that's on the mic<br />
And when I rock up on the mic, I rock the mic right!<br />
Ricky, Ricky, Ricky, Rick, Rick James… La di, da di…<br />
<br />
Rick James, The B-Boy From Buffalo!<br />
<br />
[Announcer:] Here, Rick channels the thug essence of Tupac Shakur…<br />
[Rick James:] How do you want it? (How do you want this?)<br />
And how do you feel?<br />
Coming up as a nigga in the cash game<br />
Living in the fast lane, I'm for real (Nigga, real…)<br />
And how do you want it? (How do you want this?)<br />
How do you feel?<br />
Coming up as a nigga in the cash game<br />
Living in the fast lane with Tupac…<br />
<br />
[Announcer:] Now, you can't say Rick James without thinking saxophones, and here, he touches…<br />
<br />
[Rick James:] I reminisce for a spell (hmm…), or should I say &quot;think back&quot;<br />
Twenty-two years ago, I made some funk tracks (Say it!)<br />
I was born in Buffalo on the eighth of October<br />
Came close, but my granddaddy ain't sober<br />
Reminise!<br />
I like this one… one of my personal… it's my personal favorite.<br />
<br />
Rick James, The B-Boy From Buffalo!<br />
<br />
Just kick a little something for those cars that be bumpin'<br />
[Announcer:] Alright, Rick. Well, they need a beat they can front to…<br />
([Rick James:] Yeah, alright. Well, that'll work.)<br />
<br />
[Rick James:] You know it's funky, funky, funky<br />
'Cause you heard it from here, see<br />
A jam that you're loving don't be gettin' no airplay<br />
Strictly for fronting when you're riding around<br />
Twelve o'clock at night with your windows down<br />
To the bottom, to the bottom, to the top, to the top<br />
Cruise… it's three o'clock… the boomin' system…<br />
<br />
[Announcer:] So if you love hip hop as much as Rick James, send 48 dollars for a triple LP and double CD to 4369 PO Box Prince Is A Bitch, Buffalo, New York…<br />
[Rick James:] Hey, hey, hold-hold on, let me see… let me see that micro… let me see that microphone, man.<br />
[Announcer:] Oh, Rick James is back…<br />
[Rick James:] 'Cause I want them to know: I produced all this shit on here… I-I produced it… I wanna shout out Buffalo… New York… <br />
