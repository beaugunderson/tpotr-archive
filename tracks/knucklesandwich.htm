<h1>Knuckle Sandwich <font size="1"><strong>(Kidd Lexus)</strong></font></h1>
<p><strong>Written by: Brandon Collins, Michael Turner &amp; Christopher Portugal</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>[Scratched sample:] Ladies and gentlemen… once again…<br />
<br />
[Kidd Lexus:]<br />
Yo, I blast my way out, then I spray out, just for the hell of it<br />
Civil war's in development, Lexus versus confederate<br />
I won't stop giving my lyrical onslaught<br />
That demo you got need to be sent to a pawn shop<br />
You feeling me? You constantly crying, &quot;Lexus is killing me!&quot;<br />
I'll send your ass to hell and then back, special delivery<br />
But we the good guys like Optimus Prime and Ironhide (hell yeah!)<br />
Make a homicide appear to look like a suicide<br />
So next shit, you better take heed to my message<br />
You couldn't find me with them bloodhounds and a detective<br />
Signing your death wish, fake MCs get arrested (uh huh…)<br />
There's not enough containment for them all, it's getting hectic<br />
We talked to them cats (and what'd you say?)<br />
And we came to an agreement, go on down Crescent Heights<br />
You won't get slammed on the cement (alright)<br />
So it has to be, Lex got juice like a battery<br />
Try to battle me, nigga, you must have the audacity<br />
<span class="grey-text">The harass academy</span>, learning on rough terrain<br />
Been going insane, robbing a train like Jesse James<br />
No bullshit, when it comes to flows, I got a full clip<br />
Gunning down my foes, so I suppose that I should prove it<br />
(Ain't trying to prove!) <span class="grey-text">Little kid</span>, yo, you ain't earned no staring rights<br />
So now you get burned <span class="grey-text">down</span> one million degrees Fahrenheit<br />
You parasite, I slipped the silky smooth to be in paradise<br />
<span class="grey-text">Living close to spouse for light</span>, but yo, they ain't there at night<br />
While you rhyming jiggy, my rhymes are like trashing simple fools<br />
I added back a rhyme like a <span class="grey-text">red</span> computer peripheral<br />
Your style is so predictable, (so) limited, and typical<br />
Nigga, you can't see me 'cause Lexus remains invisible<br />
Rhyme primitive, concoct a verse with deadly chemicals<br />
Captain Kidd and Thes One, two deadly individuals<br />
<br />
[Scratched sample:] Woo-ee! I said, &quot;Say no more, brother!&quot;<br />
<br />
[Kidd Lexus:]<br />
Yo, yo, yo… Lyrical bandit, Lexus the individual running rampant<br />
Got a better advantage, my quicker-than-rapid transit<br />
Hip-hop fanatic, fiending them beats like an addict<br />
Don't peep the status, it's havoc when I switch to automatic<br />
(That's right, motherfucker)<br />
Schooling human beings, being black, white, or Koreans<br />
Since the message you receiving are laid <span class="grey-text">down wit'</span> to get even<br />
Bring the drama, the Captain Kidd comma Lexus<br />
You pushing towards a death wish, watch who you mess with<br />
(Hey, you better watch yourself…)<br />
Now normally, I be lounging, grab a sack and talk some shit<br />
Walk the block and be aware of my surroundings<br />
But now, I notice (uh huh) that there ain't no innovation (yup)<br />
The <span class="grey-text">intricate prob you're</span> facing is mental evacuation<br />
But always, Lex'll be known as a rhyme buster<br />
You freaks come out at night, so I'll stay in 'til after supper<br />
Got an ill speech and an ill beat that'll still reach<br />
Crescent Heights Ave out to Malibu Beach<br />
I'm devastating (You what?)<br />
Got more rhymes than stars in a constellation (Is that right?)<br />
I don't rest, I keep on with my vocal penetration<br />
I separate myself from the usual scene (yup)<br />
Live the hip-hop life, if you know what I mean<br />
But I ain't typical, far from average, I'm like a maverick<br />
Ripping through your Polo fabric (uh), it's already been established<br />
Hold you up for ransom, hock your mic, she'd rock a Helly Hansen<br />
Extravagant with my answer, I'm an Undisputed Champ of…<br />
<br />
[Scratched sample:] Ladies and…<br />
<br />
[Kidd Lexus:]<br />
Yo, I'm ill, me and Double K be two hundred mil<br />
Be on the lookout, don't let us catch your crew in the field<br />
Time for acting, those who think my flows ain't everlasting<br />
Get smacked and on they back in a horizontal fashion<br />
K.O.'ed, while you shopping for that style you be adopting<br />
The final nail in the coffin is when you'd think I was dropping<br />
Don't hand me that, nigga, you'd have to be mentally handicapped (Sucka! C'mon!) To think I would slip just a little, save the chatter, black<br />
And you can count on the fact, when I counter-attack<br />
I might come out on my back, no time to react (Ha!)<br />
Don't copy me, nigga, this is my town, my monopoly<br />
You rhyme sloppily, and you can't function properly (No, you sure can't!)<br />
This is my territory, sipping down a cold 40 (Oh, yeah…)<br />
On the lookout at night like a star observatory (Say what?)<br />
'Cause I write the illest rhymes, only when I get bored<br />
Cutting down competition like a samurai sword<br />
But you were hesitant (that's right), so I took you out for the hell of it<br />
An easy win for me, your rhyme delivery's too delicate<br />
And if you ever question Captain Kidd Lex's rhymes<br />
I suggest you do time, 'cause that's committing a crime…<br />
<br />
[Spoken sample:] Yeah…<br />
[Scratched sample:] I mean… the best you can ask for, you might get one of them knuckle sandwiches or something like that… but you gotta remember: you gotta have the proper attitude… you know, your attitude is very important…</p>
