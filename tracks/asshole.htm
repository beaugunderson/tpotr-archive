<h1>Asshole (feat. Assault)</h1>
<p><strong>Written by: Michael Turner, Christopher Portugal &amp; K. Witcher</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>[Spoken sample:] &quot;Nah.&quot; &quot;Why don't you need shoes, homes? It's cold!&quot; &quot;'Cause Bruce Lee told me to walk like water.&quot; &quot;Walk like water?!&quot; &quot;Or to be like water, my friends.&quot; &quot;Word?&quot; &quot;Word.&quot;â€¦<br />
<br />
[Assault:]<br />
There's a fine line between love and hate<br />
So form a single-file line, so I can answer to your face<br />
And one-by-one, can you explain from whence you came?<br />
I bet it's not the grain, we ain't the same<br />
Now, all of y'all about to get your feelings hurt<br />
In them <span class="grey-text">fled-out</span> jeans, and tight civil-service shirts<br />
It hurts to see the phony hip-hop lovers<br />
Assassinating the soul and taking Jungle from the Brothers<br />
([Thes One:] <span class="grey-text">You were dripping with steel</span>!)<br />
The dance steps that we rocked, but you don't have the hip<br />
So we left 'em with trip-hop<br />
And now you're back, contradiciting what you're wearing<br />
Dressed down like a bum, knowing your mom's Donna Karen<br />
And I'll be who I am, <span class="grey-text">through</span> the way I grew up<br />
It wasn't fly to be me until this rap shit blew up<br />
So all your grave poppers cast a shadow on your face<br />
Learn the history of this, your fucking drum and your bass<br />
<br />
[Assault:] Hey, you think I'm an asshole, I think you one, too<br />
'Cause me and you, kid, we ain't the same<br />
You think I'm an asshole, I think you're one, too<br />
Yo, we ain't the same<br />
<br />
[Thes One:]<br />
You club motherfuckers get the dick<br />
Eclectica and thrift-shop hip-hop shit just makes me sick<br />
Bitch quick to say he's hip, the underground tape dubber<br />
But never even heard <em>Mecca and the Soul Brother</em><br />
But he's hip-hop personified, cast in plastic, got his ass kicked<br />
At the mall, took a hard fall on his backpack<br />
And broke his acid jazz tape (I broke my tape!)<br />
Didn't know wack from dope, and vice versa<br />
So I dropped the verse to inflict the curse of the ancient god, Ursula<br />
Deep down, I sense the fear, got a lot of gear<br />
And stay away from the heads in the rear 'cause they know too<br />
I bet <span class="grey-text">you'll flow through</span>, it's all crap, like I said<br />
I understand why some brothers snap<br />
Wanna call it innovative 'cause you know your shit's wack<br />
If it's hip-hop, stressing me out, man, something's gotta stop<br />
Before everyone and grandma's crying<br />
I'll make my dubs dirty, so these knuckleheads buy it<br />
Hanging with Erykah Badu, she on a diet<br />
Money's trying to talk to me, yo, kid, be quiet!<br />
Talking and talking and hip-hop gossiping<br />
Shut the fuck up, kid, please keep walking it<br />
You're talking and talking and hip-hop gossiping<br />
Shut the fuck up, kid, just keep walking it<br />
<br />
[Thes One:] Think I'm an asshole, I think you're one, too<br />
'Cause me and you, kid, you see, we're not the same<br />
You think I'm an asshole, I think you're one, too<br />
'Cause me and you, kid, you see, we ain't the same!<br />
<br />
[Double K:]<br />
You think I'm an asshole, then take one to the grill<br />
Thought so! We can get it on whenever you feel<br />
But you the type of punk to hide your feelings inside<br />
Won't say it in my face, wait 'til you get outside, that's right<br />
Talk that underground shit, but can't back it<br />
And when it's time to bring the heat, you don't pack it<br />
I say what I want, when I want, 'cause I can<br />
And ain't nothing stopping me, especially no fucking man<br />
I don't believe in shit-talking, walk the walk and then talk<br />
'Cause once you start yapping, I ain't thinking 'bout rapping<br />
Yo, I let the snare do the kicking since you fresh<br />
Hit me with your best, I'll talk it over with Thes<br />
And you don't want what we got, better duck and get saved<br />
Only a minute left 'til we hit the staircase<br />
With some treats for everybody and they don't look sweet<br />
More like material for mothers crying in the street (MY BABYYYY!)<br />
But I ain't trying to go there, I'd rather kick back<br />
Don't like being an asshole, man, you see, it ain't like that<br />
But fools just trip and lose they mind<br />
Try to show out in front of your boys, I'll have you doing hard time<br />
Take it from a brother who knows and keep knowing<br />
<span class="grey-text">Lift</span> your problem into butter, yo, and keep growing<br />
White boys, black boys, and all you niggas in between<br />
Give a fuck, you got beef, make sure you ain't seen<br />
'Cause we coming for you, <span class="grey-text">what's that late style</span><br />
Double kills, the Smiley loc's, and Thes One on top of the pile<br />
So <span class="grey-text">leave</span> your mouth shut when it comes to the beat<br />
Unless you're gonna have to take your problem up with P<br />
<br />
[Double K:] And, you think I'm an asshole, I think you one, too<br />
You see, me and you, kid, yo, we ain't the same<br />
You think I'm an asshole, I think you one, too<br />
'Cause me and you, sissy, we ain't the same<br />
[Rap sample:] Asshole! (repeated)</p>
