<h1>Down In LA</h1>
<p><strong>Written by: Michael Turner &amp; Christopher Portugal</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>[Sung sample:] Way down in L.A.!<br />
<br />
[Double K:] Eleven years, man, ha! It's Double K and Thes One, once again! Once again! And we feeling so cool right now, we gonna lay back and parlay to the shades (My, my, my!), so we can do it like this, yeah!<br />
<br />
[Double K:]<br />
Pen to the paper on that daily grind<br />
Don't trap, I don't snap, but I make my words fine<br />
Me and Thes combine like shower caps and slick dudes<br />
And call clubs, pulling off the rags to cruise up Crenshaw<br />
No color glamorizing, fine chick analyzing, and the homies love writing<br />
Only suckas be colliding, we got mouths to feed<br />
Barbecue at the barbershop, they smoking big weed<br />
And my man got them DVDs and CDs<br />
Five dollars or eight for two, it's up to you<br />
And everybody celebrating 'cause the Lakers just won<br />
Another reason for them tough guys to put away the gun<br />
We don't stop with the L.A. fun, we just begun<br />
Rockstars out at night, you can see they all spun<br />
Around midnight, things really start to heat up<br />
Cats get belligerent and drunk, get beat up<br />
Roll by LAPD and take them hats off<br />
Just use precaution, yeah, them boys be watching<br />
So keep flossing with that peace sign tossing<br />
Everybody keep it right, I'm off to Crescent Heights, like…<br />
<br />
[Samples scratched together:]<br />
Ah, and you don't (You are there!), ah, and you don't stop!<br />
Ah, and you don't (You are there!), ah, and you don't stop!<br />
Ah, and you don't (You are there!), ah, and you don't stop!<br />
Ah, and you don't (You are there!), ah, and you don't stop!<br />
<br />
[Thes One:]<br />
Welcome back to the West Coast, damn, it feels good<br />
Rolling clean-style, limousine, smiling through the hood<br />
Like one of those days, you feel you can't go wrong<br />
A cloud in the sky, the DJ playing the song to make the system…<br />
The winds are blowing offshore, street skaters kickflipping<br />
In front of the liquor store (What's up, man!)<br />
What's up y'all, I came for another case<br />
Hey, Double at the barbecue, I hope that I'm not late<br />
Huh, he'll save a plate if I missed the brisket<br />
Missed the 1-10 North/South for the visit<br />
If it hits south swell, then I'm out in the kelp<br />
The best rapper in your town, five stars on Yelp<br />
You see… it's Thes and Double K, holding it down<br />
The rental cars, small-time stars, all up in your town<br />
Take heed, take weed, take whatever you need<br />
Meet me at the barbecue, up the block at three, you see…<br />
We all-city, all-state, all-world<br />
Love to get drunk, party with the fine, young girls<br />
I'm a better MC than all your homeboys who rap<br />
Double K hooked up the beat with the hand clap<br />
It's like that, y'all, and you don't stop!<br />
<br />
[Samples scratched together:]<br />
Ah, and you don't (You are there!), ah, and you don't stop!<br />
Ah, and you don't (You are there!), ah, and you don't stop!<br />
Ah, and you don't (You are there!), ah, and you don't stop!<br />
Ah, and you don't (You are there!), ah, and you don't stop!<br />
<br />
[Double K:]<br />
Ha! Yeah! Yo, 213 to 310! This for all the <span class="grey-text">cars</span>, clubs and barbecue pits, Hoodrats looking for that dollar, and the OGs giving game to the youngsters. Keep doing that; we need it! And all the homies that don't use violence to settle they problems, you know what I'm saying… For everybody that like to have fun under the sun, especially with us, the P-U-T-and-the-S! Double K and Thes stay so fresh! Also, wanna give a shout-out to the 626, the 909… yeah, and even the 714, you know what I'm saying? You alright down there, it's all good. Give some love to y'all… you know what I'm saying? So, uh, go flip that barbecue over, light that up, pour your mama a drink, and just ride… Just ride… Yeah, just ride… <span class="grey-text">Go to dog</span> we're going to, now… yeah…<br />
<br />
[Samples scratched together:]<br />
Ah, and you don't (You are there!), ah, and you don't stop!<br />
Ah, and you don't (You are there!), ah, and you don't stop!<br />
Ah, and you don't (You are there!), ah, and you don't stop!<br />
Ah, and you don't (You are there!), ah, and you don't stop!</p>
