<h1>Dangerous</h1>
<p><strong>Written by: Michael Turner &amp; Christopher Portugal</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>[Double K:]<br />
Yo, everyday, I wake up, man, it's the same routine<br />
Mom's talking that shit on how she want her house clean<br />
Gotta live with that (damn!), plus I'm stressing<br />
My job done fucked me over, some say, &quot;K, this is a lesson of life&quot;<br />
Yeah right, yo, I ain't wit' it, why me?<br />
Every day, I'm subject to this black cloud that won't leave<br />
And it's raining hard as fuck, no such as an umbrella<br />
Coming down non-stop, yo, I figure I could sell<br />
A couple rocks on the block, but yo, that ain't the G<br />
So now I'm figuring out ways to try and make ends meet<br />
Flip a hustle here and there, but that shit won't last<br />
The situation gets thicker, shit starts moving fast<br />
But, like, I want to give up, and act the straight-up fool<br />
Yo, that's no kind of solution, I shoulda kept my ass in school<br />
But I had no support which gave me room to kick back<br />
No sort of college on my mind, so now, I seen that shit's wack<br />
Never thought I would say it, but damn, I shoulda listened<br />
It's a gang of shit in life that Mister Double K's missing<br />
Can't trust nobody, so I stay low-key<br />
Chain-smoke reefer blunts and put it down for the P<br />
But yo, I'm damn near twenty-one and need something better<br />
'Cause things is getting hot like Bill Cosby's knit sweater<br />
And I'll do what I gotta do just to survive<br />
Can't let it get me down, G, just keep a positive state of mind<br />
Can't dwell on the past, just watch my behind<br />
And know that, one day, everything'll be fine<br />
<br />
[Thes One:]<br />
I find I go home once in a while to wish my mother the best<br />
And realize the physical effects of stress<br />
Mom gets a rest in haste, I request<br />
But the best in this rap race get wrinkles in the face<br />
&quot;Paper chase&quot; some call it, my homie, I can't call it, I can't catch it<br />
I keep my memories on lock and key<br />
I unlatch it in a rhyme state, and Band-Aid my mind<br />
With late-night memories of pre-1988<br />
Strange, 'cause I can't cope with change<br />
And I hate the fact there's no turning back<br />
In fact, I say, &quot;It's all good&quot;<br />
When some of my friends fade, they couldn't handle adulthood<br />
And all should acknowledge hindsight is 20/20<br />
Funny: now, I'm 20, and too concerned with money<br />
And could you blame me? I wake up every day afraid and alone<br />
In the grand scheme of things, where dreams are elusive<br />
Negativity surrounds me, and builds brick barricades<br />
And that's not conducive to life<br />
'Cause me and Double K got natural rights to be happy and be free<br />
And that's not too much to ask, so back the fuck away from me<br />
And let me move forward in peace… 'cause, money, 'cause…<br />
Only time can stop me, and time I release…<br />
<br />
[Consituent:] Yeah, well like… It's like… It's like, it gets down to a thing of a slow death, uh, instead of, like… uh, uh, an instant, outright… you know, like, I'll continue along in the slow process of getting annihilated as a people, you know, instead of going on out and dealing with, uh, confrontation, uh, for whatever ends it may bring…<br />
[Mayor:] I can understand you're feeling like this. There's an awfully disturbing number of young people, black people, other minority group people, who have that same feeling that you have… that's what's dangerous…</p>
