<h1>LA Song (Sensitive Mix)</h1>
<p><strong>Written by: Michael Turner &amp; Christopher Portugal</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>[Thes One:]<br />
See, I see the people moving through the arteries and veins<br />
In cars switching lanes, dropping extravagant names<br />
Into cell phones, to real estate agents who sell homes<br />
To implants with implants dancing with chrome<br />
She's entertaining the city one dollar at a time<br />
For a little drug money, escalating L.A. crime<br />
From a fake escobar anticipating some time<br />
Just a night at the bar, taking the trouble off his mind<br />
He's drinking long islands with some cat from Manhattan<br />
Who moved away from Staten to start a career in rapping<br />
When he touched down and realized he was just another number<br />
Now, he's trying to get a zone that he can sling through the summer<br />
To them other newcomers, they're trying to get discovered<br />
They're working as a waiter, to midnight or even later<br />
At least they're getting tipped, see the cook, he's getting gypped<br />
Fuck a minimum wage, he's just another immigrant<br />
Riding the bus home, sitting next to an old crip<br />
Who finally decided to stop letting the chrome rip<br />
But not before he caught a hollow-tip that gave him a limp<br />
He passes by every night, smoking a pimp<br />
I say, &quot;What's up?&quot; ([Double K:] What's happening, man?)<br />
And that's how we do<br />
I guess we're both repping L.A. in our own special way<br />
Two of a kind, Double K and mine, finding peace of mind<br />
Watching the daily grind from our mission to record find<br />
Rectifying them underlying currents in L.A.<br />
There's no Plan B 'cause the city don't play<br />
See, I understand my role in the city of L.A.<br />
There's no Plan B 'cause the city don't <span class="grey-text">eh</span><br />
<br />
[Rap sample:] I <span class="grey-text">stay</span> in… (repeated)<br />
[Double K:] Everybody wanna be <span class="grey-text">this smooth</span> rapper from L.A.… It ain't L.A., and didn't even come from L.A. They come here, trying to put a new brand, a new stamp on what we done already started back here, you know? We listened to the greats, the King Tee, the Mixmaster shows, and KDAY. Wasn't all this ol' wild shit you're hearing now, man, it was real shit back then… and who knows what shit's turned into, <span class="grey-text">I know what we got…</span><br />
<br />
[Double K:]<br />
The summer of '7-7, God gave his only rider<br />
To a city of angels with broken-down fables<br />
Dominoes was on the table, brown liquor in cups<br />
My pops was the man out on the streets cutting up<br />
That Hollywood swinging on that natural high<br />
Stepping outta line or high-stepping got you by<br />
But now there's gangs that's banging and signs is hanging<br />
Crooked cops pulling over for the same old thing<br />
And my registration's in my melanin, and that's a reason for a beating<br />
In Los Angeles, it stays nigger season<br />
So you got to have a smile on your face (and oh yeah)<br />
Or show 'em how you really feel and they gon' go for the waist<br />
It happened to my homie, man, and it won't happen to me<br />
Quit throwing up the C, became a real OG<br />
By murdering tracks, burning the wax through stacks and stacks<br />
Blowing it like greenbacks in the back of the 'Lac<br />
Remembering the good days, trying to get my feet wet<br />
Smoking blunts with my friends (hey, man, how high can you get?)<br />
But some got too high, and they never came down<br />
And no matter what happened to my folks, I'm still down<br />
That's what my city taught me, never be a copy<br />
Stay ahead of the pack, keep your eyes on your back<br />
Look both ways before you crossing this place<br />
You'll get lost in this place, tossed in the space of mind<br />
That you want to get out of (and that you want to stay out of)<br />
So I stay doing something to keep my unborn proud of<br />
Pops was rolling <span class="grey-text">stoned</span> with his shoes on the concrete<br />
And month after week, the people pay to hear me speak<br />
I got the gift of gab and known for the soul grabbing<br />
A product of L.A., I know you see my pants sagging<br />
<br />
[Rap sample:] Fresh out Los Angeles<br />
[Rap sample:] We dropping science<br />
[Rap sample:] Fresh out Los Angeles<br />
[Rap sample:] Penetrating<br />
[Rap sample:] I stay in… I get it…<br />
[Rap sample:] Fresh out Los Angeles<br />
[Rap sample:] We dropping science<br />
[Rap sample:] Fresh out Los Angeles<br />
[Rap sample:] We dropping science<br />
[Rap sample:] Fresh out Los Angeles<br />
[Rap sample:] Penetrating mind<br />
