<h1>Noonen</h1> 
<p><strong>Written by: Christopher Portugal</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>[Spoken sample:]<br />
[Danny Noonan:] Can I ask you something?<br />
[Ty Webb:] Sure thing. Shoot, Timmy.<br />
[Danny Noonan:] Danny.<br />
[Ty Webb:] Danny.<br />
[Danny Noonan:] When you were my age, did you ever have trouble deciding what you wanted to do with your life?<br />
[Ty Webb:] [scoff] No, I never had that problem, really. Why?<br />
[Danny Noonan:] Forget it. I didn't think you'd understand.<br />
<br />
[Thes One:]<br />
Time to face the boss at the end of the first stage<br />
Face devil, end level, unlatch the cage<br />
Send letter home, the kid's coming of age<br />
Love, comma, sign the page, drop drama, a daily rage<br />
And I'mma call the morning with my mind made up<br />
Culminating thoughts of many long nights, stayed up<br />
In front of a mirror, trying to find truth<br />
A slipshod photo-booth snapshot of fading youth<br />
And that's ruthless, get funny like that farm<br />
So sublime on the passage of time, impress <span class="grey-text">kind</span><br />
Appreciate nature now, dignity and labor now<br />
Transcendental mental state, NAFTA with my neighbors<br />
Now, I'm meeting with your mind, can take you back into time<br />
Few years after Willy Wonka, but right before Blanka<br />
Donut shop, Street-Fighting, rhyme-writing<br />
Late-nighting, light-sleeping, rolling with the beeper<br />
I'm just citing how it changed 'cause the pain and memories<br />
Are good times, but they co-signed<br />
With the enemies of innocence and <span class="grey-text">decided God</span><br />
I guess it's kinda sad moving on, but then again, set the alarm…<br />
<br />
[Thes One, doubled:]<br />
So, tomorrow, I'm getting up at eight o'clock<br />
C'mon, Noonan, you're getting older, gotta stop<br />
So, I'm setting the clock for sunrise<br />
And whatever lies ahead: I'm facing it by getting out of bed<br />
So, tomorrow, I'm getting up at eight o'clock<br />
C'mon, Noonan, I'm getting older, gotta stop<br />
So, I'm setting the clock for sunrise<br />
And whatever lies ahead: I'm facing it by getting out of bed<br />
<br />
[Thes One:]<br />
You might be wondering why I wrote this rhyme? 'Cause it's time!<br />
Jumping out the sheets as soon as the sunshine with the grind<br />
Before noon, so before the moon<br />
Hits the skyline, lets enzyme <span class="grey-text">entomb</span> a rhyme<br />
Keep my mind high-free, it's the least I could do<br />
I've been blessed with life, living off the giving to you<br />
So for ears lent, here's a year's rent, at least<br />
Much more than fifty cent and not a platinum piece<br />
Some peace of my mind, rappin' on the state of releasing<br />
Divine happening through rhyme, creatin' a sunshine for the inner<br />
Getting off at least two meals before dinnertime<br />
And the mind set to achieve<br />
I'm in winter, not akin to life beginner<br />
In a <span class="grey-text">dark mold</span>, hold a <span class="grey-text">cold cold</span>, follow the road<br />
Less traversed, <span class="grey-text">hold</span> mindset, stay terse<br />
Tryin' to make the situation better and not worse<br />
So tonight, I'll finish this verse, turn off the light<br />
Set alarm for eight a.m., blam! with the night<br />
Rake together memories, step back and ignite<br />
Wake to the sunlight of the rest of my life<br />
<br />
[Thes One, doubled:]<br />
So, tomorrow, I'm getting up at eight o'clock<br />
C'mon, Noonan, you're getting older, gotta stop<br />
So, I'm setting the clock for sunrise<br />
And whatever lies ahead: I'm facing it by getting out of bed<br />
So, tomorrow, I'm getting up at eight o'clock<br />
C'mon, Noonan, you're getting older, gotta stop<br />
So, I'm setting the clock for sunrise<br />
And whatever lies ahead: I'm facing it by getting out of bed<br />
<br />
[Thes One:]<br />
Get the fuck up! This is for the cats in the back sayin' &quot;What up?&quot;<br />
Looking around, asking what happened to hip hop<br />
It fought so hard to not be pop, it's over the top<br />
And underground associated teenage angst<br />
It feels like a race issue, there's dissent in the ranks<br />
So whatever, I sever my ties, it doesn't change<br />
Where my memory lies, or how it applies to now<br />
Still b-boy for life, I hear a beat and go wild<br />
But some of us are starting families and having child<br />
It doesn't make the style mild, just makes it mature<br />
B-boys are growing up, it's time to open some doors<br />
Giving up the idea of giving up<br />
Setting the alarm, getting up, and living it up<br />
Feeling the cup more than half full, and more than hip hop<br />
And more than &quot;yes, y'all!&quot; 'til my heartbeat stops<br />
I'm waking up, still the hot shower<br />
Still the same bed, just living a new hour<br />
Man, I'm face-to-face with the rest of my life<br />
Plus remain calm, and have more time, set the alarm<br />
<br />
[Thes One, doubled:]<br />
So, tomorrow, I'm getting up at eight o'clock<br />
C'mon, Noonan, you're getting older, gotta stop<br />
So, I'm setting the clock for sunrise<br />
And whatever lies ahead: I'm facing it by getting out of bed<br />
So, tomorrow, I'm getting up at eight o'clock<br />
C'mon, Noonan, you're getting older, gotta stop<br />
So, I'm setting the clock for sunrise<br />
And whatever lies ahead: I'm facing it by getting out of bed<br />
<br />
[Thes One:] Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up…<br />
<br />
[Spoken sample:] What an incredible Cinderella story, this unknown comes out of nowhere to lead the pack…<br />
<br />
[Thes One:] Get up!<br />
Get up! (Wake up!) x7<br />
Get up! (Wake up! Wake up, man!)<br />
Get up!<br />
<br />
[Spoken sample:] But seriously, no BS…<br />
([Thes One:] C'mon, get up…)<br />
[Spoken sample:] You ever want to rap, man…<br />
<br />
[Thes One:] Get up… wake up… get up… get up… wake up… c'mon, man, Mom made pancakes… get up…</p>
