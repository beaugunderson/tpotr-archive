<h1>You Lied</h1> 
<p><strong>Written by: Michael Turner &amp; Christopher Portugal</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>([Spoken sample:] Uno! Dos! Uno! Dos! Uno! Dos! Uno! Dos!)<br />
<br />
([Double K:] You might not want to play it, but somebody had to say it...<br />
[Spoken sample:] Bitch!<br />
[Double K:] You might not want to play it, but somebody had to say it, you...)<br />
<br />
[Thes One:] (Hey...)<br />
Homeboy, you just turned 30<br />
You're lying to yourself, to your girl, and to your mom<br />
Until they make playing Playstation an occupation<br />
Get your ass off that futon and get a job!<br />
For real... this other dude still thinks he'll get a record deal<br />
&quot;Hey, buy this meal. I get you back when I get put on.&quot;<br />
Alright, man, but it might be a little long for that<br />
Broke, 39, you're old dudes writing raps?<br />
You've been lying to yourself, now you're lying to me<br />
Like when I call my record label, trying to find out 'bout my royalties<br />
&quot;Ay-yo, the check's in the mail. Don't be mad at me!&quot;<br />
You lying motherfuckers like them...<br />
Hilarious... you probably hate this song<br />
But if the fuckin' shoe fits, you should probably put it on<br />
And walk a mile in it, 'cause there's no smiles<br />
When it effects the people in your life, trying to get along<br />
<br />
[Both:] You LIED, motherfucker, you LIED!<br />
[Spoken sample:] Bitch!<br />
[Both:] You might not want to play it, but somebody had to say it...<br />
(x4)<br />
<br />
[Double K:] You lied...<br />
I'm like Mr. T... I pity the fool<br />
Who lies like it's high school, you know that ain't the rule ([Thes One:] Motherfucker...)<br />
I heard your music, and you was talking 'bout my town on stage? (Motherfucker...)<br />
Then I bruise you fuckin' clowns!<br />
See, where I come from... man, it's all about your word<br />
You ain't never smelled cocaine, you punk-ass nerd<br />
Claiming that you a pimp and moving all that big weight<br />
Never been to the beach, let alone been out-of-state (Shut the fuck up!)<br />
See, I talked to your girlfriend, she told me you's a loser<br />
She takes all your frustrations 'cause your album ain't out<br />
And always claiming big status, looking to me for a handout<br />
Dumb nigga, get a job, I see your nose growing<br />
Every time you take a drink, your insecurities are showing<br />
You a liar... and man, I heard it all before<br />
Parents gave you everything, and you choose to act poor<br />
&quot;Man, I had it rough growing up.&quot; Shut up. You a liar!<br />
&quot;I get respect in the hood.&quot; No, you don't. You a liar!<br />
&quot;Yo, I be hittin' hella chicks!&quot; Man, you can't. You a liar!<br />
&quot;Yo, my uncle started the crips!&quot; For real, my nigga?? You a liar!<br />
<br />
[Both:] You LIED, motherfucker, you LIED!<br />
[Spoken sample:] Bitch!<br />
[Both:] You might not want to play it, but somebody had to say it...<br />
(x4)<br />
<br />
[Spoken sample:] Bitch! (repeated and scratched)<br />
[Double K:] You LIED! You LIED! Nigga... yo, you know we had to say it... you LIED!<br />
[Thes One:] Get that shit right, man.<br />
([Rap sample:] And when you lie and you talk a lot. People tell you to step off a lot.)<br />
[Double K:] Motherfucker, you're responsible for who the fuck you are, man. You're an idiot. Me and Chris know that shit. That's why you lying all the fuckin' time, man, talking about what's coming out, what ain't coming out, what you did, and what you ain't did. Shut the fuck up, man. Just make some music, do what you gotta do, and live your life, sucka.</p>

<ul>
<li>Soundcloud description: &quot;This is a track that got recorded for our 2008 release, <a href="/albums/fundmc.htm">Fun DMC</a>, but didn't fit the vibe - we try and keep it fun related and this was just venting off a lot of steam and frustration, so we buried it.&quot;</li>
