<h1>Hang Loose Pt. 2</h1> 
<p><strong>Written by: Michael Turner &amp; Christopher Portugal</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>[Man:] Okay, <span class="grey-text">tochubolair</span>… People Under Stairs… O.S.T.?… Shh, the best crazy guys in the world… Wow…<br />
<br />
[Spoken sample:] Party! Woo wee!<br />
[Thes One:] Alright…<br />
[Spoken sample:] I like that! Mm-mm-mm…<br />
[Thes One:] C'mon, Mike!<br />
[Double K:] Hey… and we just reaching for it, little brother…alright… let's give the band some right here…<br />
[Thes One:] Check it out…<br />
<br />
[Double K:]<br />
It goes music, money, success, and the booze<br />
They all in one pocket, which one would you choose?<br />
Reunited with the groove, jamming on the one<br />
Got a dark pair of shades, making MCs run<br />
Take up the theater or some spoken word<br />
'Cause I'm smoking herbs with a conjunction to word<br />
Well, how rude of me, I didn't introduce<br />
My buddies call me young Double, known to hang loose<br />
Might cause a little trouble, burn down the roof<br />
Sprinkle wine on the ladies, deny a couple of babies<br />
But I'm still the MC with the stars in his eyes<br />
Got <span class="grey-text">flows on the rise</span>, a big bag of fries<br />
Potato strut, y'all, potato strut<br />
Guaranteed to be nice with the right uppercut<br />
No remorse, I'm on course and no turning back<br />
Unless I'm doing the bump, sipping on some 'gnac<br />
You might see me looking cooler than the wind chill factor<br />
The <span class="grey-text">been ill</span> rapper, displays skills faster<br />
At the speed of light for your delight<br />
Busting rhymes at midnight, smooth sailing on a bike<br />
Papa Willie's the nickname, and don't you forget<br />
The slick rhyme poetry, turntable-loving MC<br />
Heartily partying at the edge of a cliff<br />
I'mma pass the .38, now y'all shoot the gift<br />
<br />
[Double K:] It ain't nothing but a party, y'all, front to back<br />
To the dude in the black, don't act so wack<br />
Hey, girl in the green, don't look so mean<br />
And that dude in the blue, what's wrong with you?<br />
[Thes One:] And to the lady in the red, if you heard what it said<br />
[Double K:] A-just nod your head, a-just nod your head!<br />
[Thes One:] And to the brotha with the dreds, green, yellow, and red<br />
[Double K:] A-just nod your head, go'on, nod your head!<br />
<br />
[Thes One:]<br />
Well, I just don't know, but it just might be<br />
Time to party down with the people, the P<br />
See, I made a lot of tracks with my brother, Mike T.<br />
The party-rocking, cold-shocking, chopping a beat<br />
See, I never lost a battle, never claimed defeat<br />
I rock a house party, drink beer in the street<br />
Tripping with my peeps, getting something to eat<br />
<span class="grey-text">For me, a-</span>drink a little liquor and pass the Hennessy<br />
See, them good-life living, fun guys giving<br />
The party with the women that likes to go swimming<br />
The nice car driving, the stone profiling<br />
Shining up a dollar while my cash flow piling<br />
I'm the old school smiling with the gold in the front<br />
So smoke a little blunt and let's all get drunk<br />
Don't hold a grudge and don't be a punk<br />
You can play the Judge Wapner, now we'll pump the funk<br />
Stay up all night, you wanna party all day<br />
You work all week just to collect your pay<br />
Your boss is a jerk, you don't know what to say<br />
And hey, the ladies say &quot;hi,&quot; but don't give you no play<br />
The way of the world, so you might as well rock<br />
Conflict overseas while they fart on the block<br />
Only thing you can do: change your attitude<br />
And jump on the floor and hang loose, dude<br />
<br />
[Double K:] It ain't nothing but a party, y'all, front to back<br />
To the dude in the black, don't act so wack<br />
Hey, girl in the green, now, I know what you mean<br />
And that dude in the blue, what's wrong with you?<br />
[Thes One:] And to the lady in the red, if you heard what it said<br />
[Double K:] A-just nod your head, a-just nod your head!<br />
[Thes One:] And to the brotha with the dreds, green, yellow, and red<br />
[Double K:] A-just nod your head, go'on, nod your head!<br />
[Thes One:] Cool it out, now!<br />
[Double K:] Uh!<br />
<br />
[Double K:] We gon' jump out, right here, right-right now…<br />
[Guy #1:] Huh? Yeah!<br />
[Guy #2:] Told me to get drunk now…<br />
[Double K:] Well, check out, go on, get on over there…<br />
<br />
[Double K, partially accompanied by crowd:] Everybody in here, say:<br />
I feel like busting loose… c'mon… busting loose… Hold up, what?<br />
I feel like busting loose… give me something, brother<br />
[Spoken sample:] Action! Party! Woo wee! I like that! Mm-mm-mm…<br />
<br />
[Mingled voices… too hard to make out…]<br />
[Every now and then:] I feel like busting loose… busting loose…<br />
[Thes One:] And you don't stop…<br />
[Double K:] Ain't never been to a party like this…<br />
<br />
[Double K:] Was that good?</p>
