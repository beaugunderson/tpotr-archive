<h1>Choke A Mic Out <font size="1"><strong>(Kidd Lexus)</strong></font></h1>
<p><strong>Written by: Brandon Collins, Michael Turner &amp; Christopher Portugal</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>[Kidd Lexus:] (Yeah, I'mma bring a little something like this…)<br />
I choke a mic out, enough to make niggas like you get psyched out<br />
And knock your lights out, come back and erase you like Wite-Out<br />
Lyrical, I'm super, I guess you heard the rumor<br />
That when I be smoking Buddha, dialing 9-11 proves it<br />
I'm really blowed, that's when I was deep into my Philly mode<br />
Really doe, you have ultraviolet dreams, mine are indigo (What?)<br />
I heard you talking that your shit is the stuff<br />
But how can that be when I write and know your rhymes every month<br />
I got lyrics with team spirit, be that though I'm solo<br />
You heard it, but yet you still fear it, while I'm keeping mobile<br />
I'm moving, I'm on the rise, you fucked up, nigga, surprise<br />
Then I <span class="grey-text">set a round</span> that got you right between the eyes<br />
'Cause I'm immaculate, all my vocal shots, perfectly accurate<br />
And you can't handle it, Lex one, you should run<br />
I be doing my thing, nigga, so how you like me now?<br />
<span class="grey-text">Reared</span> on the concept of smooth <span class="grey-text">like the</span> Thurston Howells<br />
<br />
[Rap sample:] I got rhymes 365 days, annual <span class="grey-text">plus some</span><br />
[PUTS sample:] Beware and don't enter<br />
[Rap sample, scratched:] I got rhymes 365 days, annual <span class="grey-text">plus some</span><br />
<br />
[Kidd Lexus:]<br />
A microphone assassin dedicated to keeping niggas clapping<br />
I'm back, and dedicated to rapping, your reacting (Say what?)<br />
I'm cutting niggas to pieces, into confetti<br />
More heavy than a Chevy, you ain't ready, no need to worry<br />
I will disintegrate any opponent that'd move quick<br />
Before I bury every opponent for my amusement<br />
Now, I'm laughing and chuckling, ready to erupt<br />
When I'm magnificent and stuff, <span class="grey-text">don't be battled or</span> you got cut<br />
I slice you deeply and all my anger got released<br />
You were devastated, you tried to cut me, but I levitated<br />
Then I waited, only a matter of time<br />
Before I kick another rhyme that will splatter your mind<br />
Your rap capabilities stink, remind me of manure<br />
Get to you on the low, so I maneuver through the sewer<br />
I was wearing Timberlands, so the water didn't seep through<br />
That's my favorite brand, that's what Thes can make the beat to<br />
And if you like it, raise your marker in the sky<br />
Sip down a 40, or whatever gets you high<br />
But recognize, matter of fact, I will <span class="grey-text">live rise</span><br />
And my vocals be a weapon and my lyrical design<br />
To be coming, to take you on a tour throughout my dungeon clan<br />
Bombed a shack of <span class="grey-text">right angles</span>, prevent you from running<br />
You ain't going nowhere, so motherfuck your time of year<br />
You know very well, I'd rather rock my Aéropostales<br />
Get a cap from Abercrombie, but yo, that ain't the subject<br />
You say that I've changed, but yo, nigga, you need to stuff it<br />
All that drama that you speak, don't be speaking it to me<br />
You don't deserve a microphone 'cause you ain't a real MC… uh…<br />
<br />
[Rap sample:] I got rhymes 365 days, annual <span class="grey-text">plus some</span><br />
[PUTS sample:] Beware and don't enter (x2)<br />
<br />
[Kidd Lexus:] (Bring it live, y'all…)<br />
I'm here to eliminate the simpletons, <span class="grey-text">fence</span> the ladies and gentlemen<br />
Confiscating the dividends, Lexus is back to sin again<br />
Do what I did to win again, now it's time to finish, I'm menacing<br />
You sweet like cinnamon, intimate thoughts you knew<br />
I'm stomping you and whole crew, I mean your whole crew of two<br />
Or twenty-five, I'm still live<br />
It doesn't matter, niggas scatter when Lexus presents the standards<br />
See my image in cable static, flip the channel than panic<br />
Get sunk like the Titanic, a million depths than vanish<br />
Reported critical damage, flipping vocal acrobatics<br />
Get tangled in my lyrical apparatus, you got a wicked freestyle<br />
So check the status… I'm Lexus<br />
I take a rest, when I know that I've won<br />
But I'll never take a rest 'cause there's <span class="grey-text">new</span> work to be done<br />
I represent Crescent Heights and the UDC crew<br />
Silver satin for the night 'cause you know how we do<br />
I write a paragraph of rhymes 'til I run out of ink<br />
Switch pens, do it again, then I stop, and I think<br />
I got rhymes for every occasion 'cause I'm so amazing<br />
I battled a crew of fifty, was the last one remaining<br />
That shit is real, nowadays, niggas be ill<br />
<span class="grey-text">You decide</span> to rhyme to <span class="grey-text">a pen</span>, it's like you're rhyming <span class="grey-text">with steel</span><br />
But that's okay, I ain't tripping, eventually I'll catch you slipping<br />
See, my style ain't switching, you deserve an ass-whipping<br />
I'm the K-I-double-D, Mr. L-E-X, <span class="grey-text">you rest beats</span><br />
The real MCs and DJs who's resided in the West, uh, yeah</p>
