<h1>Ten Tough Guys</h1>
<p><strong>Written by: Michael Turner &amp; Christopher Portugal</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>[Double K:] Mm-hm…<br />
[Thes One:] That's right…<br />
[Double K:] C'mon folks! Move it! Lemme get one line here!<br />
<br />
I got ten MC's, held up in a line<br />
'Cause all these dudes told me that they knew how to rhyme<br />
So which one should it be that I choose to test first<br />
The way he grabbed the mic showed signs of a pussy, and even worse<br />
He was talkin bout a gat that wasn't tucked in his waist<br />
So I recorded him &quot;ass&quot;, into the next sucka's face (next!)<br />
This fool was pretty dope, told him, &quot;keep up the good work&quot;<br />
Gave him a pound and a pimp, moved on to this next jerk<br />
Ay-yo, dude looked like Usher with his chest all exposed<br />
Busting 'bout bitches he been hitting, his stupid-ass clothes<br />
Big smile on his face like there were hands in the air waving<br />
But I was anticipating <span class="grey-text">that Satan would</span> see him baking<br />
Under the authority of someone lower than me<br />
Started gettin tired, skipped three, now here's the seventh MC<br />
Looked like a pretty cool guy, but sounded like Trench (Hay! Ho!)<br />
Moving around all fast, screaming, with weapons around his neck<br />
It was like a fuckin joke, me and the gang got a good laugh<br />
He got all hot, tried to dulo, we beat his fuckin ass like:<br />
(Look at you now… <span class="grey-text">amarosa</span>!)<br />
Number eight was a female, at least that's how I figured,<br />
Until it started rapping, sounded like one of my niggas,<br />
&quot;Goddamn&quot; this, that, and all the guns in the world<br />
Harder than most niggas on the mic, even had a Jheri Curl (damn!)<br />
Sent her to Jenny Jones, for the little makeover, told her<br />
&quot;Be back in two weeks!&quot; you see, all I wanted to do was bone her<br />
Word, she's out like yesterday's six-pack, so let's get back to the last two<br />
Yo, they're from the same crew, what should we do<br />
Thes said he knew them niggas from some open mic spot<br />
They tried to nut up, got cut up, so here's round two<br />
<br />
[Thes One:] Yeah! You, money! You talking to me?<br />
[Wack rapper (Thes):] You got a battle rap? Battle me!<br />
[Double K:] Wassup then?! Wassup?<br />
<br />
[Thes One:] Yo…<br />
What would you do if I could prove you didn't exist and it was true<br />
Like <span class="grey-text">a missed come true</span> to solve solidified proof of your essence<br />
Of you in the spoof of your birth<br />
Now I guess that would lessen your worth to the dirt and the earth<br />
And the leaf, now I leave you alone without belief that your really here<br />
And assist you beneath your fear, an endearing tear would fall<br />
If all that I said was true… am I right or <span class="grey-text">to it</span> or just both<br />
Too complex for a quote? I'll have the final say<br />
Like the rope to the boat to the dock, you're not free yet, man<br />
You're sick, stuck, caught, sick in the head, stuck to the bed<br />
You're <span class="grey-text">dumbfed</span>, diseased with that mononucleo-<br />
What'd I look like money?! That Latin listening to Coolio?<br />
So, I ask, what was your mom's task when she had you?<br />
If only she knew, though, that through all of her pain<br />
Her baby was born without brain and insane and just plain with no style!<br />
No smile, your memories are worth a shitpile to me<br />
You believe that you're free!?! Man, free from your mom<br />
Free from the man, and most of all, free from me?<br />
But you see, I've caught you! My bad, you don't really exist<br />
So I've got to, explain this, so when I tell you how not to<br />
You won't do it, I screw with your thinking<br />
I know I exist, and I'll prove it 'cause I'm listening to you<br />
But I ask: what if God was an evil genius who only made you<br />
Believe you were true, and your life was nothing, man<br />
Just a really long dream, and when you die<br />
You'll start a whole new life, a whole new dream?<br />
But that was just a dream, and it seems, man<br />
You can't break out the cycle… Am I crazy?<br />
Go to your church and ask your white God if I'm right, yo<br />
([Wack rapper (Double K):] Yo, I don't go to church!)<br />
Whatever he replies will be lies, we've already established its evil<br />
When I'm lying, you don't exist, but merely as emotion and perceival<br />
Believe you'll be around tomorrow, kid?<br />
Yo, you've borrowed time with no interest,<br />
And since you're a dream, I can mentally put on the pinch<br />
And you disappear in an instant, fool… What?! What?!<br />
<br />
[Double K:] Nigga, fuck you! You can't rap anyway. Yeah, we up out of here! ([Thes One:] Sucka!) Sucka-ass niggas! Eat a dick! People Under The Stairs…</p>
