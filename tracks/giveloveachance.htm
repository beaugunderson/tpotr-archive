<h1>Give Love A Chance</h1>
<p><strong>Written by: Michael Turner &amp; Christopher Portugal</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>[Sung sample:] Why don't we give love a chance? (x2)<br />
<br />
[Double K:]<br />
Yo, let the brother rap for a minute, let me get in it<br />
Got some things I wanna speak about, the topics gonna creep about<br />
And peep: a young man around twenty<br />
Really, he ain't balling, basically, ain't got no money<br />
There's nobody on his side 'cause his love is the ones and twos<br />
Back and forth all night, making it right<br />
Now, everybody in his cipher got something to say<br />
&quot;Ay-yo, you need to quit scratching, man, that shit won't pay!&quot;<br />
And pops kicked him out, put his tables on the street<br />
Just 'cause he wasn't down with the ITT<br />
But he knew they'd catch the vapors, one day or another<br />
So he dropped his boy a &quot;please&quot; to take him down to his brother<br />
Now, he cooling with his brother, but he bugging 'bout the papes<br />
Ain't trying to hit the little club on Wednesdays and mix tapes<br />
&quot;That junk ain't paying no bills, who you trying to fool?&quot;<br />
So once again, this jockey Joe Blow is on the move<br />
And now he's house-to-house, sleeping on the floor<br />
With his jacket for a blanket, steady-thinking 'bout before<br />
All he needed was his peeps to sit and watch him succeed<br />
Nobody blows up overnight and every one of us need<br />
Some kind of push and support, without that, you're sure to slip<br />
Get to drinking and flipping, not thinking and always wishing<br />
Yo, I got a solution, it's called &quot;showing some love&quot;<br />
We all guilty of not doing it, you can hear it above, it's like…<br />
<br />
[Sung sample:] We should take the time…<br />
[Thes One:] To sit back, unwind, unbind your mind from the grind and…<br />
[Sung sample:] Why don't we give love a chance?<br />
[Sung sample:] Like you know you should<br />
(x2)<br />
<br />
[Thes One:]<br />
See, what the world needs now is love, hope, and support<br />
Greed got 'em bleeding, teaching, making money for sport<br />
And cash role models for all the little kids that love them Swizz Beatz<br />
Shit, when I was young, I watched Sesame Street<br />
To all you young b-boys: keep doing your thing<br />
Don't let 'em tell you otherwise 'cause you ain't making no green<br />
American cash machine keeps rolling with or without<br />
We got a subculture to save, and I'll be damned if I shout<br />
Some shit over tracks that's wack to make a fat stack of cheese<br />
Hip-hop is my art, only myself I can please<br />
<br />
[Double K:]<br />
It doesn't matter what you wanna be, focus and move ahead<br />
Make sure you do it for yourself and not off what some others said<br />
'Cause when you go that way, it ain't from the heart<br />
What we do is what we been doing from the start<br />
Ain't making music for executives, sitting behing a desk<br />
I tell them fools to eat a dick and bring it live to they chest<br />
'Cause this is art that we created, you get paid with respect<br />
A little patience and pride, and with that, you pose a threat<br />
Take a heed, young brother, to the words I speak<br />
Unless you wanna see your promos lying there in the street<br />
'Cause money is man-made, and anytime, it can be gone<br />
Just kick back, spark one up, and peep the words to the song<br />
<br />
[Sung sample:] We should take the time…<br />
[Double K:] To sit back, unwind, unbind your mind from the grind, ya…<br />
[Sung sample:] Why don't we give love a chance?<br />
[Sung sample:] Like you know you should<br />
<br />
[Thes One:]<br />
When push come to shove, I rise above, sort of<br />
Keep my eyes, mind focused on the goal that is love<br />
So when fans give it, I rip it, return it, earn respect<br />
See, I'm in it for that and not a fat paycheck<br />
On that C-note, you can quote Thes, 'cause I said it's true<br />
Money doesn't equal happiness, no matter who smiles<br />
Or piles checks, while I'm on the steps, drinking Beck's with my friends<br />
Piecing our 40s 'cause we don't got ends<br />
Memories like that, to me, are Los Angeles palm trees<br />
Life landmarks telling me to see these at ease<br />
My friends are worth G's, enemies can sit in pawn shops<br />
I'mma worry about the riffing when the sunset stops<br />
Listen to simple pleasures, the measures are always greater (what?)<br />
Like Double K ripping Fatback upon a cross-fader<br />
Little girls laughing and waiting for ice cream trucks<br />
These images I wouldn't trade for a million bucks<br />
So when chasing the goal gets rough and says &quot;life sucks!&quot;<br />
Remember: the lining's silver and that's always good enough<br />
So when chasing your goal gets rough and you lose steam<br />
Count your blessings, my peoples, don't be so mean!<br />
<br />
[Sung sample:] We should take the time…<br />
[Spoken sample:] Don't be so mean!<br />
[Sung sample:] Why don't we give love a chance?<br />
[Spoken sample:] Don't be so mean!<br />
[Sung sample:] We should take the time…<br />
[Sung sample:] Why don't we give love a chance? (x2)<br />
[Spoken sample:] I don't know…<br />
[Sung sample:] Why don't we give…</p>
