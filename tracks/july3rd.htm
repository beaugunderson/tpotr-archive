<h1>July 3rd</h1>
<p><strong>Written by: Michael Turner &amp; Christopher Portugal</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>([Double K:] Be having bad days…dudes be going through shit… it's ain't hip-hop all day, man… niggas got feelings and shit… steady pissing fools off just like you'd do with anybody, dude… I mean… the P's going through it… and we always going through it, but… you know, <span class="grey-text">weed</span> this out…)<br />
<br />
[Double K:]<br />
Yo, woke up kinda mad, although it wasn't late<br />
Today was a day that I thought would be great<br />
Was supposed to spend some time with this girl<br />
Who claims she mine, it was like a 1-year or something<br />
Yo, I'm not quite sure. Anyway, I was chilling around 11 a.m.<br />
And old girl was out preparing for the bomb p.m.<br />
So I was supposed to cheeba chief, and making tracks or whatnot<br />
My nigga, Joe Cool, came through and said the homie got shot<br />
Now, even though he's still alive, it put a damper on the day<br />
Hollered at my old lady, and she said she on her way<br />
So, it was about 2 o'clock when this chick rolled up<br />
Said she'd missed her hair appointment, now she's all choked up<br />
I said, &quot;Fuck the hairpiece, just put it in a ponytail!&quot;<br />
I shouldn't have said that, this girl raised all hell<br />
Started crying and sobbing about her day fucking up<br />
Wasn't thinking 'bout mine, so I began to loc up<br />
Yo, I had to catch myself (&quot;Michael, cool out.&quot;)<br />
So, I went into &quot;man&quot; mode and tried to talk this shit out<br />
Now, here I am, comprimising, but that didn't work<br />
The whole time I sitting, feeling like DJ Jerk<br />
Then she goes, calls her homegirl, the one I don't like<br />
&quot;Oh, come and do some products, you can do my hair, alright?&quot;<br />
Now mind you, I don't like this bitch or her ways<br />
And suddenly she's in the midst of my <span class="grey-text">supposedly date</span><br />
So. I jumped up and acted like I wasn't mad and said, &quot;Cool.&quot;<br />
When really, I could've shot both them hos and felt good<br />
But yo, that ain't the way, so I just mobbed the hood<br />
See my man Kurt Loco, he said, &quot;What's up with the 4-0?&quot;<br />
Threw my problem in a bottle, smoked him out and was gone<br />
Soon as I get home, yo, my moms is on the phone<br />
Yelling and bitching about me not doing something<br />
Now, I'm known to lack, and get sidetracked<br />
But I was really trying to do it, and she wasn't hearing that<br />
Told me to beat it, &quot;go to hell,&quot; and hung up the phone<br />
I'm like, &quot;Damn! It's 5:30, and I'm still at home, yo<br />
Mom's on one, and this bitch is out bullshitting?&quot;<br />
I'm sitting in the room with the JBs on blast<br />
With the time ticking fast, now, I wanna kick some ass<br />
Ay-yo, fuck that (fuck that bitch)…<br />
I'm gonna get mad all over again, dude, let me get calm<br />
Yo, she finally showed up about an hour later<br />
With her hair looking no better than the first day that I met her<br />
You know, I'm all drunk and blunted the fuck out of my mind<br />
Don't wanna hear no &quot;sorry,&quot; stupid, let's just have a good time<br />
[Double K:] And I guess we did it, man, you know, she kinda made it up to me…<br />
[Thes One:] Word?<br />
[Double K:] Still, man, the day was all fucked up! Little Nookie got blasted on and shit…<br />
[Thes One:] Damn!<br />
[Double K:] You know, then I see my ex-bitch, dude! What the fuck?<br />
[Thes One:] Damn. That's fucked up, man.<br />
[Double K:] You know, that's what I'm saying, my nigga.<br />
[Thes One:] That shit's fucked up, yo. Shit's just…<br />
[Double K:] Damn, man… Shit, just, you know.<br />
[Thes One:] It's July 3rd! What can you say but… you know?<br />
[Double K:] God damn. You done what? What happened?<br />
[Thes One:] Man! What? It happened to me too, man!<br />
<br />
[Thes One:]<br />
July 3rd, lazy Saturday afternoon<br />
Drinking cold lemonade, just finished cleaning my room<br />
See, I presumed, at that point, there was nothing else to do<br />
I took the jeep down the street and copped a 40 of brew<br />
As I'm riding, I decide I'd rent a Genesis game<br />
Turned right on Western, pass the red-line train<br />
Park my car on the main corner, Third and Hobart<br />
Walked across the street to Young's Game and Video Mart<br />
Once inside, I realized I had forgotten my card<br />
Said &quot;peace&quot; to the guard, told him I'd go back to my car<br />
Went outside, pushing buttons, and the light turns green<br />
Stepping to the crosswalk, now imagine this scene:<br />
A tan '88 Dodge minivan didn't stop<br />
He's doing thirty, headed for me in the damn crosswalk<br />
Out of shock, I did my best to try and jump back quick<br />
We made eye contact, right before I was hit!<br />
I jumped up, missing a shoe, shocked and dazed<br />
Blood pouring out my body, traffic stopped both ways<br />
The dude is trying to throw me into his van to take off<br />
I can't even walk straight, let alone fend him off<br />
He's begging bystanders not to call the police, shit<br />
Giving me eleven dollars 'cause I've just been hit<br />
His sob story lasted 'til the paramedics arrived<br />
Witnesses crying, saying &quot;lucky to be alive!&quot;<br />
Eight hours later, alone, getting a CAT scan<br />
Trying to go back and understand the randomness of it all<br />
Damn! That's the answer I get:<br />
One minute you're here, the next you're…</p>
