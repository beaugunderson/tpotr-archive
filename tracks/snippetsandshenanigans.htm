<p>[Mother:] …need a daddy, but you do have one, and you need to deal with that. Now, I want you to go see him in the hospital. TJ, I don't ask you to do that much around here, and if you don't want to do it for me, at least do it for yourself.<br />
[Stepfather:] Hey! What's with the faces?<br />
[Mother:] Hey, baby, how was work?<br />
[Stepfather:] Shit, it was work, how you think it was? Haha. You get a job yet?<br />
[Stepkid:] Naw, I got some groups I'm working with, though<br />
[Stepfather:] Some groups you workin' with? Haha, as your Stepfather, I can tell you: that is not a job! That's an excuse! Hahahaha, I's just messing with you, boy. You go on out there and get those record deals, and maybe we can be the next Jackson family. I can go out and get me a nose job and change my address! Hahaha, I'm gonna watch me some Celebrity Jeopardy<br />
[Mother:] Okay, baby…<br />
[Random man:] Your husband is crazy.<br />
<br />
<a href="../tracks/stepin.htm">Step In</a> plays from 2:08 to 2:54 (last chorus)<br />
[Double K voiceover:] Yo, yo, yo, yo. Brand new shit, man. People Under The Stairs, right? Thes One and Double K, on the Stepfather tip! April 18th, 2006, yeah… one more time for your mind, right? Stepfather! Eat your eggs fo' we break your legs, sucka! You know? Los Angeles' finest, back up in the house! Puttin' you on punishment, yeah!<br />
<br />
<a href="../tracks/tuxedorap.htm">Tuxedo Rap</a> plays from 0:00 to 1:02 (Opening &amp; most of first verse)<br />
<br />
[Thes One:] Alright, man. Kool Moe, you know, it's really, uh, it's really a pleasure to have you on this snippet tape, man. I just wanna ask you, you know: what you been up to, man? What's life been like for you, you know, since you started listening to People Under The Stairs?<br />
[Kool Moe Dee sample:] Uh… money, drugs, &quot;bling bling&quot;, party… wow, we don't have anything else to talk about?<br />
[Thes One:] Uh, uh… yeah, man… uh, yeah, okay… uh, well, sh- you know… What are you looking for, from our new album, Stepfather? You know, we got a new album coming out, and, uh… and I know that you had some requests of what you wanted to hear us do, in a new direction we were gonna try and take, you know what I'm sayin'…<br />
[Kool Moe Dee sample:] I need something the breakers can't break on, and something the DJ can't really, really get too crazy on… drum beats! It's not gonna be [imitates scratching]. That's all you can really do with a drum beat. But if you have &quot;Danna, nanna, nanna deeew–eew –eew!&quot; Horn slashes? Don't rhyme on horn slashes. DJs can cut… they can mess you up…<br />
[Thes One:] Oh yeah, definitely, def-… well, you know, man… you know, I'm definitely inclined to trust someone who wears, uh, sunglasses like that, you know? I mean, I mean… I think people wanna know, you know, why you rock those things, you know?<br />
[Kool Moe Dee sample:] I can see behind the beat. I can see what you're doing ([Thes One:] Word, word.) and what you're not doing 'cause the music is not in the way for me.<br />
[Thes One:] Oh, man, I- I- seriously, though, I wanna talk about this, uh… this long-standing rivalry you've had with Double K, I mean… you know, you… you dissed him, you know… you really, you know, you been kinda harsh on him, you know. But I think deep down, you really like him, you know? I mean, what do you… what do you really think about my man, now that, you know, y'all… y'all are so…<br />
[Kool Moe Dee sample:] He's an excellent rapper because he… he flows excellently in the groove. His voice stands out. He has a very, very smooth tone, and he's an excellent artist. But that doesn't mean that I'm sitting there, lookin' at it like it's Shakespeare, either, because I understand… in its simplicity, there's the magic.<br />
[Thes One:] Yeah, yeah, right, right, right, but I mean like, you know, after The Next Step, you kinda dissed him, and… and, you know, it was kinda mean. It was kinda hardcore, man, you know?<br />
[Kool Moe Dee sample:] Well, at that point, it was simplistic. It was more innocent, but it had also gotten into a one-note, &quot;party, say ho, say glow, say&quot; this ([Thes One:] Word, word.) And I was like… Nobody's doing anything with the rhyme stuff.<br />
[Thes One:] Well, he took it to heart, man. You know, we really tried to step it up on Question and &quot;O.S.T.&quot;, and you know, he wanted to do that song &quot;Outrage&quot;, I mean… you know, flippin' it and stuff, I mean… wh-what do you think of that song we had on… on… on &quot;O.S.T.&quot;, that song &quot;Outrage&quot;?<br />
[Kool Moe Dee sample:] It was a nice rhythm there. And I was, like, thinking, &quot;Why don't you keep that going?&quot;, and like… do the whole rhyme in a cadence that's not: &quot;Rock to da di, da di da dee, duhdaduhdaduhdadada, da di da dee&quot;… I was like, &quot;Nah, take the 'duhdaduhdaduhda'!&quot;<br />
[Thes One:] I mean, like, we do all that, and you still dissed Double K! I mean… Why, man?<br />
[Kool Moe Dee sample:] He knows he's not doing certain things at a certain level.<br />
[Thes One:] Yeah, but I mean, you know… just an MC thing…<br />
[Kool Moe Dee sample:] Didn't mean he wasn't a g- a great MC on a certain level, but… when you start sayin' you're the best, I'm like, &quot;Wait a minute, that… that should mean something!&quot; It's almost like tellin' somebody you love them. That should actually mean something. You shouldn't just say it, so… uh, for me… uh, my competitive juices got going, and I… uh, again…<br />
[Thes One:] Yeah, yeah, yeah, ch-check… yeah, yeah, right, man… I don't… I don't mean to cut you off, but, you know…<br />
[Kool Moe Dee sample:] Uh… I hope that answered the question…<br />
[Thes One:] There's a real famous story about you guys, you know, uh… getting kicked out of a gym in, uh… in Sacramento, you know… I mean, you almost left him to get kicked out, you know… it's real famous, real funny story, man, when you guys were in that weightlifting crew together. I think some of this beef stems from that. Why don't you go ahead and break it down about that, you know, the weightlifting crew in… and getting kicked out…<br />
[Kool Moe Dee sample:] He's in on my word, I can't just cut him off, and… and K is sitting there, now this is funny 'cause he would never admit this, but K was sitting there, sweating like, &quot;Am I out?&quot; Like… &quot;I can't believe I just got kicked out of this group. I'm finding a rhythm. I finally got a home,&quot; because it never occurred to us that we could all be solo…<br />
<br />
<a href="../tracks/passthe40.htm">Pass The 40</a> plays from 0:23 to 1:26 (first verse &amp; chorus)<br />
<br />
<a href="../tracks/eatstreet.htm">Eat Street</a> plays from 0:00 to 1:45 (opening, Thes' verse &amp; chorus)<br />
<br />
[Double K:] Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah… we're back on W-E-F-U-N-K, man. We're with the fabulous, the <em>fabulous</em> James Brown. What's going on, man? Where you been?<br />
[James Brown sample:] Living in America…<br />
[Double K:] Ahhh, okay, okay, I mean, you… well, you know, you been the band, you know…  you been with your wife, th-<br />
[James Brown sample:] Heh heh, nothing wrong…<br />
[Double K:] Naw, man. I mean, you been with your wife, you've been touring with the band, I mean… who… you know…<br />
[James Brown sample:] Let's talk about some music!<br />
[Double K:] James! Uh… right now… seems to me that you're high, man…<br />
[James Brown sample:] Huh? Heh heh heh…<br />
[Double K:] James?<br />
[James Brown sample:] Nothing wrong…<br />
[Double K:] Are… James, you're high.<br />
[James Brown sample:] No, I'm not!<br />
[Double K:] Alright, man, so how would you feel about going on tour with People Under The Stairs? I mean, you think that'd be a cool thing? Come out there, do some dances? I mean, how you feel about that, man?<br />
[James Brown sample:] Yeah! I mean, uh… I'm sing-uh… I wanna mingle.<br />
[Double K:] Cool! Cool, cool… great to hear, great to hear…<br />
[James Brown sample:] No…<br />
[Double K:] Now, it seems to me in the past, you know… I read a couple of interviews… you were concerned about, uh… People Under The Stairs, we weren't making music that was, uh… &quot;dancer friendly&quot;? I mean, what's going on with that, man? Can you explain that to me?<br />
[James Brown sample:] I'm, I'm concerned 'cause there's nothing wrong…<br />
[Double K:] So, James, man. I heard, you know, when you used to tour with the JB's, you guys went around, all… all around the world, man. You know, you learned some different languages, man, you know… Let me hear some of that, man. I never heard James Brown talk in a different way.<br />
[James Brown sample:] I say, yo say cara muchas…<br />
[Double K:] Oh, that's fly… that's fly, man…<br />
[James Brown sample:] Danke schon…<br />
[Double K:] So, there you have it, y'all. Sitting here with James Brown on W-E-F-U-N-K, and he says go buy the new People Under The Stairs album, Stepfather!<br />
[James Brown sample:] Yeah!<br />
[Double K:] Tell 'em, James!<br />
[James Brown sample:] Ahhhhhhhhhh!<br />
[Double K:] There you have it…<br />
