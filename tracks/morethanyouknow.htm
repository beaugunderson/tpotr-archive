<h1>More Than You Know</h1>
<p><strong>Written by: Michael Turner &amp; Christopher Portugal</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>[Sung sample:] Need you more than you know<br />
(more than you know) (x2)<br />
<br />
[Double K:] Yes, sir (Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Yes, sir!)… I'm feeling it!<br />
<br />
[Double K:]<br />
Got rid of some luggage, I'm ready for some loving<br />
Got my acts together, I need a main thang<br />
Time to relax better, made mistakes in the past that was weak<br />
After getting what I wanted, I wouldn't speak<br />
Out macking with the homies, I never got lonely<br />
Wasn't paying attention, I was too busy <span class="grey-text">getting taxed</span><br />
Smoking on sacks, breaking MC's backs<br />
Had to take some time out to find out where my head was at<br />
Apparently, it was downtown, hanging at the club<br />
Coming home out of mind, out of pocket, that was enough<br />
To make a real woman leave and slam the door<br />
Couldn't even try and blame her, and didn't wanna tame her<br />
Became bitter, destructive, you know I didn't care<br />
Started looking up and finding myself nowhere<br />
Now I'm somewhere confused, high and dry<br />
Trying to get it together, word to my mother, I try<br />
But that P-funk with that uncut prevents that<br />
Sticking my chest out, being tough, yeah<br />
It's that macho &quot;I don't care, don't need nothing&quot; attitude<br />
But really (but really), but really ([Thes One:] Really… hah!)<br />
<br />
([Sung sample:] Need you more than you know<br />
(more than you know) (x2))<br />
[Double K:] It's just something I gotta say<br />
There's something I gotta share<br />
Some people, they gotta have it, some people, they don't care, but I…<br />
[Thes One:] Because I need to let you know, so we can grow<br />
Let's get it together, share some time<br />
See the point of the rhyme is that I…<br />
([Double K, under Thes:] She know, and I know<br />
We know, they know, he know…)<br />
[Double K:] It's just something I gotta say<br />
There's something I gotta share<br />
Some people, they gotta have it, some people, they don't care, but I…<br />
She know, and I know, he know, we know, you know that uh…<br />
<br />
[Thes One:]<br />
You know that times got rough and stuff<br />
I said I'd take back, but growing up is tough<br />
When prone to overreact, my own pride<br />
Like holding back, showing tough sides when you cried<br />
I know I lacked some qualities, spin a few lies<br />
Had some late apologies and false compromise<br />
I watched us change and organize this life together, nights together<br />
We fighted through the stormy weather<br />
I said I'd never forget or just let go, the anger carries on<br />
I let go through stereo, still not a problem<br />
Or at least, I didn't say so safely always been so cautious<br />
Hardly realized I almost had lost this, relationships get deep<br />
I'm waking up at night wondering, I can't sleep<br />
It's time to take the leap, I wish I was a safe bet<br />
Looking down, nothing but ground with no safety net<br />
Yet regret? Never! No thoughts and no sound<br />
I'm just saying, it would kill me to let you down<br />
We're laying concrete, covering our lost ground<br />
And I don't say it enough, but you know I'd lay my life down, because I…<br />
<br />
([Sung sample:] Need you more than you know<br />
(more than you know) (x2))<br />
[Double K:] It's just something I gotta say<br />
It's something I gotta share<br />
Some people, they gotta have it, some people, they don't care, but I…<br />
[Thes One:] 'Cause I need to let you know, so we can grow<br />
Let's get it together, share some time<br />
See the point of the rhyme is that I…<br />
([Double K, under Thes:] And I know, he know, she know…)<br />
[Double K:] It's just something I gotta say<br />
It's something I gotta share ([Thes One:] Yeah…)<br />
Some people, they gotta have it, some people, they don't care…<br />
[Thes One:] Because I need to let you know, so we can grow<br />
Let's get it together, share some time<br />
See the point of the rhyme is uh…<br />
([Double K, under Thes:] And I know, she know, we know, he know, they know, let's uh…)<br />
[Sung sample:] Know (more than you know) (x2)<br />
<br />
[Sung sample:] Need you more than you know<br />
(more than you know)</p>
