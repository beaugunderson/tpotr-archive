<h1>Pulp Fiction (feat. Murs)</h1>
<p><strong>Written by: Michael Turner, Christopher Portugal &amp; Nick Carter</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>[Explorer #1:] Yeah… so we gotta find us a place to hole up for the night… It's gonna be dark soon, and I don't wanna be caught sleeping in the open…<br />
[Explorer #2:] We seem to be on the edge of a big swamp! Maybe we can find a place in there. Sure give us plenty of cover, trees and things…<br />
[Explorer #3:] Ugh, I don't think I like it.<br />
[Explorer #2:] What do you think, Alan?<br />
[Explorer #1:] I think I'd rather take my chances in there than out here… let's go!<br />
[Narrator:] Making their way carefully through underbrush and mud, the three friends suddenly come to a small clearing…<br />
[Scratched sample:] You've nothing to worry about…<br />
<br />
[Murs:] As we made it to the clearning, I was fearing the worst<br />
You see this wild-ass jungles? Never meant for Murs!<br />
I'm used to the urban terrain, smoking beedis, graffiti<br />
Niggas serving cane, now I'm stuck in the middle of this dense-ass jungle<br />
The sun was still shining, but it was pouring down rain…<br />
[Thes One:] Rain, my brainstorm <span class="grey-text">came</span><br />
&quot;Where the fuck are we at? Ay-yo, Double K? Aw, shit.&quot;<br />
[Murs:] &quot;Where the fuck did he go?&quot;<br />
[Thes One:] &quot;Yo, Murs, we in trouble, man!&quot;<br />
[Murs:] &quot;Aw, shit…&quot;<br />
[Thes One:] We lost a third of the trio, I'm stumbling over evil roots<br />
I hear flutes in the distance, it's getting dark, &quot;<span class="grey-text">Clark</span>, you hear that?&quot;<br />
[Murs:] &quot;Damn, sounded like a Chinese water rat,&quot; I pulled out my strap<br />
Ready to slaughter and attack, but I didn't see shit, man<br />
Maybe it's the wind, my patience wearing thin<br />
'Cause I'm stuck in the jungle with nothing but men<br />
Wanna search for K, but I don't know where to begin<br />
Plus, that nigga got the beedis, ain't that ain't no joke<br />
While life lessons got my ass stressing, so I'm ready to smoke<br />
[Thes One:] Light campfire, &quot;I admire your eagerness to rest, just think<br />
We need a place to stay, been walking through<br />
This goddamn swamp all day, now, it's time to find Double K<br />
And take off the backpack, smoke the beedis…<br />
Yo, you know where he's at?&quot;<br />
<br />
([Double K:] &quot;This is stupid, man…&quot;)<br />
[Murs:] &quot;Yo, where the fuck did he go?&quot;<br />
[Thes One:] &quot;He was behind us, you know?&quot;<br />
[Double K:] &quot;Man, what the hell y'all niggas doing over here chilling?<br />
You didn't hear me whistling?&quot;<br />
[Thes One:] &quot;Man, Murs, I told you it wasn't a flute!&quot;<br />
[Double K:] &quot;Well, that's bullshit! You shouldn't have left me!&quot;<br />
[Murs:] &quot;Man, where the fuck the beedis at, man?&quot;<br />
[Double K:] &quot;Ah, alright. Well, look, man: I was over there pissing, right?<br />
([Thes One:] &quot;Right…&quot;) ([Murs:] &quot;Yeah.&quot;)<br />
And this big ass monkey, looking like Suge Knight<br />
With tattoos and a blue rag took the pager and the beedis<br />
([Thes One:] &quot;Haha&quot;) ([Murs:] &quot;Oh, for real?&quot;)<br />
Man, I couldn't fight back!<br />
[Murs:] &quot;What? Alright, shit, which way was he headed?<br />
Seems like the day that I dreaded, worst nightmare:<br />
No broads? No beedis? No beer? Kaos, nigga, get your ass over here!<br />
You gon' lead the way. No nicotine's the last shit I need today!&quot;<br />
[Thes One:] &quot;I say, my friends, you see that cave up on the hill?<br />
I say we hike up, strike up a match, and campfire for the light<br />
Watch the nightfall, and speak upon our situation<br />
And try to figure out how we gonna get back to our nation…&quot;<br />
<br />
([Murs:] &quot;…Fucking beat that nigga's ass…&quot;<br />
[Double K:] &quot;Ain't got no beedis and shit…&quot;<br />
[Murs:] &quot;Ay-yo, we shouldn't have left JazMak, though, I wanna know if he's alright…<br />
[Double K:] &quot;…Don't know if he made it…&quot;<br />
[Murs:] &quot;Hey, Kaos, you're burning my bat! Gimme my bat wing! Yo, yo, chill. I wanna eat that shit, fool, I'm hella hungry!&quot;)<br />
<br />
[Double K:] &quot;Yo, can I ask one question, dude: where the fuck we at?<br />
Niggas posted in a cave, now tarantulas and bats?<br />
I wanna go back to the hood before I catch some kind of exotic disease<br />
Please, somebody call the park ranger<br />
I keep hearing sounds that get stranger and stranger, plus the sun's up<br />
Yo, it's time we take a walk!&quot;<br />
[Murs:] &quot;Hey, Kaos, if we don't find my beedis<br />
I'mma have to pull your ass to the side, so we could have a talk<br />
Plus, last night, I didn't get no rest, and that food that we ate?<br />
Hella hard to digest. I think if we could reach the beach, that'd be best<br />
'Cause then we could pull out a map to find out where the fuck we at<br />
And maybe somebody could see us, so I say we head west.&quot;<br />
[Thes One:] Now, walk and I walked, tripped over a walk<br />
I'm dehydrated, sun slated, it's pole position on my back<br />
Looking for a way back to sea from the land and sand and we could<br />
Probably flag down a ship, skip off the continent and then get<br />
Back in time for our show. &quot;Double K, do you know<br />
Where this fucking monkey's at? I want my beedi pack back, man!&quot;<br />
[Double K:] &quot;Y'all niggas worrying about beedis?<br />
Dude, I'm trying to be out, and I ain't fucking with that monkey.<br />
He look like he had clout… but fuck it. I'm down. We can go<br />
And <span class="grey-text">hem him</span> up, get the smoke back. He probably over there.<br />
Hey, Murs, look in my backpack. Undadog left his loop water<br />
In the little pocket. Right there.&quot; ([Murs:] &quot;Right where?&quot;)<br />
&quot;Right there… yeah, in that little&quot; (&quot;This one?&quot;)<br />
&quot;Yeah, that little funky shit…&quot;<br />
<br />
[Murs:] &quot;Oh, hell yeah. That's cool. Remember 'Red Dots', fool?&quot;<br />
I'm gonna used that black tube, but damn… what could I use<br />
As the needle for injection? Upon my inspection, I found a thorn<br />
Could perform the same task, so I hollowed that shit out<br />
Connect it to the flask, now I'm looking for that bitch-ass monkey<br />
'Cause I'm ready for his ass…&quot;<br />
[Thes One:] &quot;Bitch ass… Yo, this shit's an ambush. Y'all push<br />
A tree trunk in his way, throw some empty &quot;A&quot; Bus passes in the air<br />
As a decoy, then you slay the beast and us B-Boys'll take back the beedis<br />
Eight steps back, we need the assistance of K Boogie<br />
([Double K:] &quot;I'm right here!&quot;), so if the plan of attack fails<br />
Yo, give the monkey a noogie!&quot;<br />
[Double K:] &quot;Hey, y'all shut up. I see his big ass right there<br />
Lamping on a rock with his crew, I'mma go in front and play the bait<br />
Y'all wait where you at, until you see him attack<br />
Then, Murs, you come from the back, and get the Mangalores<br />
Throw 'em to Thes, and then we'll flee… you got that?&quot;<br />
([Murs:] &quot;Alright.&quot;) &quot;Alright. C'mon, Thes, follow me. Let's go.&quot;<br />
([Thes One:] &quot;Okay.&quot;)<br />
[Murs:] The plan's <span class="grey-text">to the</span> good…<br />
Looking like that fool just hit 'em up with his hood, so I scream mental<br />
Then I stabbed him in the back of the neck with the sherm<br />
And beat his bitch-ass down…<br />
<br />
([Murs:] &quot;Where's my motherfuckin'… I want my motherfucking beedis pack… fuckin'…&quot;<br />
[Double K:] &quot;Get that nigga… get 'em…&quot;<br />
[Murs:] &quot;Stop spittin… Oh, shit, there go his homies!&quot;<br />
[Thes One:] &quot;Oh fuck!&quot;<br />
[Murs:] &quot;Hey, Thes, c'mon!&quot;<br />
[Double K:] &quot;Let's book…&quot;<br />
[Murs:] &quot;Hey, yo, fuck this… I ain't trying to fight no brothers…&quot;)<br />
<br />
[Thes One:] Running like a nose through the bush, ripping my clothes<br />
I pushed leaves, jumped in between trees, dip past banana plants<br />
And sea breeze hit my face, salt-spray taste, jumped over the space<br />
Between a rock and the sand, landed one hand down (&quot;Oof!&quot;)<br />
Look what I found! &quot;Man, I thought you died<br />
When the plane went down!&quot; (&quot;It's JazMak!!&quot;)<br />
[Murs:] &quot;Aw, man!&quot; Tripped over Thes, fell right into the clear.<br />
Oh, shit, it's JazMak! That fool hands me a beer<br />
But fools is still coming up strong from the rear, and so he's like &quot;Here.&quot;<br />
Handing me the AK-47 with three clips<br />
Aw, I bucked them niggas down like an Evil -D remix!<br />
[Double K:] Ain't that a bitch? JazMak came back on a Hoovercraft<br />
With some ladies from the island. &quot;Yo…<br />
You know what we just went through to be alive? We was striving!<br />
Had to kick twelve monekys in they ass for the pink pack of smoke.&quot;<br />
But at least we was rescued, and now we can leave<br />
And get the fuck away from this damn place… &quot;Y'all with me?<br />
Shit, I gotta be at Boston Market in about five hours… let's be out.&quot;<br />
<br />
[Double K:] Ocean got a motherfucking… shit…<br />
[Thes One:] Gangsta ape?<br />
[Murs:] … wandered from the Bronx. You know what happened last time…<br />
[Thes One:] Some shepard pies…<br />
[Double K:] Like… I don't know…<br />
[Murs:] Man, fuck the primates, man…<br />
[Double K:] Hey, let's go look from some marijuana plants, though.<br />
[Murs:] I just wanna kill all…<br />
[Double K:] You know where they got some marijuana plants 'round here?<br />
[Murs:] Hey, killa?<br />
[Double K:] I know they got some marijuana plants 'round here…<br />
[Murs:] Gorilla killa! Killa… killa…<br />
[Double K:] Bomb-ass marijuana.<br />
[Thes One:] Sea-sick-ass monkeys…<br />
[Double K:] Fuck that, man, I ain't going with y'all. Let me off the boat.<br />
[Murs:] Man, I don't know if JazMak can drive this fucking… hovercraft… you know? That nigga don't know what he doing…<br />
[Double K:] Let me off the boat… Ay, let me off the boat, I'm about to go try and find some plants.<br />
[Murs:] Man, fuck that… You know… D.A.R.E.<br />
[Double K:] Nigga… fuck that.<br />
[Thes One:] Y'all learn how to swim<br />
[Double K:] Alright, let's go back to the hood.<br />
[Thes One:] Aight, peace.</p>
