<h1>Smokin' Blunts</h1>
<p><strong>Written by: Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Michael Turner &amp; Christopher Portugal</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>[Thes One, with echo effect:]<br />
For those of you who are just following what's going on now or just tuning in… I'm on a ship, all my homies are dead and won't stop looking at me, and I shouldn't have killed the bird… let's go!<br />
<br />
Within the shadow of the ship<br />
I watched their rich attire:<br />
Blue, glossy green, and velvet black,<br />
They coiled and swam; and every track<br />
Was a flash of golden fire.<br />
<br />
O happy living things! No tongue<br />
Their beauty might declare:<br />
A spring of love gushed from my heart,<br />
And I blessed them unaware:<br />
Sure my kind saint took pity on me,<br />
And I blessed them unaware.<br />
<br />
God bless you, oh sea snake…<br />
I'm not home…<br />
<br />
The selfsame moment I could pray;<br />
And from my neck so free<br />
The Albatross fell off, and sank<br />
Like lead into the seaaaaaaaaa.&quot;<br />
<br />
The sea…<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh sleep! it is a gentle thing,<br />
Beloved from pole to pole!<br />
To Mary Queen the praise be given!<br />
She sent the gentle sleep from heaven,<br />
That slid into my soul… Goodnight!<br />
<br />
The silly buckets on the deck,<br />
That had so long remained,<br />
I dreamt that they were filled with dew;<br />
And when I awoke, it had rained.<br />
<br />
Yeah…<br />
<br />
My lips were wet, my throat was cold,<br />
My garments all were dank;<br />
Sure I had drunken in my dreams,<br />
And still my body drank.<br />
<br />
I moved, and could not feel my limbs:<br />
I was so light –almost<br />
I thought that I had died in sleep,<br />
And was a blessed ghost.<br />
<br />
Boo! Boo…<br />
<br />
The roaring wind, it roared far off<br />
And it did not come anear;<br />
But with its sound it shook the sails,<br />
That were so thin and sere.<br />
<br />
The upper burst into life!<br />
And a hundred fire-flags sheen,<br />
To and fro they hurried about!<br />
And to and fro, and in and out,<br />
The stars danced on between.<br />
<br />
The coming wind doth roar more loud,<br />
And sails did sigh like sedge;<br />
The rain pours down from one black cloud;<br />
And the moon is at its edge.<br />
<br />
Hark! Hark!<br />
<br />
The thick black cloud is cleft<br />
The moon is at its side:<br />
Like waters shot from some high crag,<br />
The lightning falls with never a jag,<br />
A river steep and wide.<br />
<br />
Here it comes: GOOO-RAH! Oh yeah… Oh…<br />
<br />
The strong wind reached the ship, it roared<br />
And dropped down like a stone<br />
'Neath the lightning and the moon<br />
The dead men gave a groan. Uhh!<br />
<br />
They groaned, they stirred, they all uprose,<br />
Nae spake, nae moved their eyes;<br />
It had been strange, even in a dream,<br />
To have seen those dead men rise.<br />
<br />
Oh my god…<br />
<br />
The helmsman steered, the ship moved on;<br />
Yet never a breeze up blew;<br />
The mariners all 'gan work the ropes,<br />
Where they were wont to do;<br />
They raised their limbs like lifeless tools – <br />
We were a ghastly crew.<br />
<br />
The body of my brother's son<br />
Stood by my knee to knee:<br />
The body and I pulled at one rope,<br />
But he said nought to me.&quot;<br />
<br />
And I quake to think of my own voice<br />
How frightful it would be (Uh!)<br />
They daylight dawned<br />
They dropped their arms,<br />
And clustered round the mast;<br />
Sweet sounds rose slowly through their mouths,<br />
And from their bodies passed.<br />
<br />
Around, around, flew each sweet sound,<br />
Then darted to the sun;<br />
Slowly the sounds came back again,<br />
Now mixed, now one by one.<br />
<br />
Sometimes a-dropping from the sky<br />
I heard the Lavrock sing;<br />
Sometimes all little birds that are,<br />
How they seemed to fill the sea and air<br />
With their sweet jargoning!<br />
<br />
Tweet, tweet, tweet, tweet…<br />
<br />
And now 'twas like all instruments,<br />
Now like a lonely flute;<br />
And now it is an angel's song,<br />
That makes the heavens be mute.<br />
<br />
It ceased; yet still the sails made on<br />
A pleasant noise till noon,<br />
A noise like of a hidden brook<br />
In the leafy month of June,<br />
That to the sleeping woods all night<br />
Singeth a quiet tuuuuuune.</p>
