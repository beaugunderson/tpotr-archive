<h1>The Promise</h1> 
<p><strong>Written by: Christopher Portugal</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>[Thes One:]<br />
I got another daddy now, I call him <span class="grey-text">Duddy</span> G<br />
I got another mommy now, I call her Mummy G<br />
In September two-double-o-three, got down on one knee<br />
With decision for permission, please listen to my plea<br />
I said, &quot;I love your daughter, Ritu, with all of my life<br />
And if you give her hand in marriage, I will make her my wife<br />
And if permitted, I'm committed to provide, by her side<br />
But I respect the old traditions, so I'll let you decide.&quot;<br />
He said, &quot;Alright, you can marry my daughter.<br />
I see she really loves you, who am I to try to stop her?<br />
We'll celebrate straight, on the rocks Johnny Walker<br />
Get the party popping like Orville Redenbacher&quot;<br />
Y'all she's the love of my life, can't you see?<br />
Rejoice in my voice like jai mata dee<br />
Yelling it out, we got a long path ahead<br />
But we will walk it hand-in-hand because we're newlyweds<br />
I said, we'll walk it hand-in-hand because we're newlyweds<br />
We will walk it hand-in-hand because we're newlyweds<br />
I said, we'll walk it hand-in-hand because we're newlyweds<br />
<br />
So God bless all of you for being so close<br />
Providing that support when I need it the most<br />
It's just a toast to my family and all of my friends<br />
(Like who?) Like Paula, Rahul, Alex and my main man, Ben<br />
We may not have a lot of money, but we got what counts<br />
In ample amounts, yes, unconditional love in ample amounts<br />
Surrounds her, profound, <span class="grey-text">still</span> ring around her finger<br />
Lingering love, a lifetime above <span class="grey-text">alsigulah</span><br />
Watch, just say it, and I'll cook her some dal<br />
What? You learned to cook dal? Yeah, I cooked the naan too<br />
So Mrs. Ritu Marwah Portugal, this one's for you<br />
<br />
Hey, I found my soulmate, and I made her my wife<br />
I guess I love the arts, pain, struggle and strife<br />
Day-to-day, you know what they say<br />
But it really doesn't matter 'cause today is our day<br />
I said, I found my soulmate, and I made her my wife<br />
I guess I love the arts, pain, struggle and strife<br />
Day-to-day, you know what they say<br />
But it really doesn't matter (today is our day)<br />
<br />
I'm not a doctor or a lawyer, more like an engineer<br />
Translate heart to art form for your ear<br />
I'm damn proud of who I amâ€¦ say, Pops, why would I lie?<br />
I'll commemerate this day with something money can't buy<br />
That's my job. Artists in the house? (Oh, my God!)<br />
It could be worse, she could be marrying a frog<br />
With dandruff, Dockers and an IT job<br />
Pushing on the money, trying to get a green card<br />
I mean, sir, my love is the only reason why I'm here<br />
My love is pure, it's like a never-ending pier<br />
Out into the ocean, that's diluted with the fear of the unknown<br />
But pillars out of ocean, that's as solid as stone<br />
Even though they're getting windblown<br />
From all the hot air, see, I really don't care<br />
These kids are soulmates, what a beautiful pair<br />
Not a care in the world, apparently girls seen<br />
Only in your dream world can actually be true<br />
'Cause this is <span class="grey-text">over seeing</span> love with Ritu<br />
Everybody stop baggin', man, my love is true<br />
So please, remember that I'm loving Ritu<br />
Hey, I found my soulmate, and I made her my wife<br />
I guess I love the arts, pain, struggle and strife<br />
Day-to-day, you know what they say<br />
But it really doesn't matter 'cause today is our day<br />
I said, I found my soulmate, and I made her my wife<br />
I guess I love the arts, pain, struggle and strife<br />
Day-to-day, you know what they say<br />
