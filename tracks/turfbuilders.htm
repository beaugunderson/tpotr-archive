<h1>Turfbuilders</h1> 
<p><strong>Written by: Michael Turner &amp; Christopher Portugal</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>[Double K:] A fresh rhyme recital for the kids like... let's do this. Yo, yo... yo, pump that beat, man. You know what I'm sayin'? I need to hear that. Yo, pump that beat up, yo. Yeah... Right there, right there.<br />
<br />
[Double K, sped up:] Ay-yo, ay-yo, ay-yo. Yo, what I need y'all to do is come up in this booth, right? I need y'all to kick some of them fresh, fly, funky, stinky rhymes that y'all be kickin', right? I want all the kids to know who you motherfuckers is, man.<br />
<br />
[Thes One:]<br />
We step on stage from state to state and measure our weight with the...<br />
Crate-slinging, hustling, shuggling, twelve-smuggling this real funk<br />
Snoopy might sniff it and customs, they might check it<br />
The punks open it up, suitcase be full of records<br />
Visa stamp, he's a champ, let him do the interlude in hotels<br />
Tell them bellboys we rude<br />
The P gon' raise the roof like Amish folk<br />
Then let the sucka burn like the <span class="grey-text">trauma Thai/traumatize</span> smoke<br />
Being the big loc, billy-goating the local dames<br />
Where they not only know the name but happy we came<br />
So here it is, rockin' live, just me and my buddies<br />
Controlling the kids through music like teletubbies<br />
Best under the sun and relatively ([Spoken sample:] Lovely)<br />
Brixton dug me, hard-hitting rugby rhythms<br />
Be getting 'em bubbly, the clubs be spinning<br />
So funked up, they get home and can't sleep on it<br />
You gonna throw it up when you see the P on it<br />
Honestly, tonic and gin is my Huckleberry Finn<br />
A lot of adventrues, I don't know where to begin<br />
Um... what was I sayin' while that P-Funk be playin'?<br />
Man, you're rocking with the Jaz, the Thes, the Double K<br />
And with the love and the town... and love and what... (Hey, hey, hey, hey)<br />
<br />
[Thes One:]
Ay-yo, pump me up, yo, we covering ground<br />
Now, the P be pumping it up by tearing it down<br />
And y'all love this sound, it goes... to the...<br />
Yo, pump me up, yo, we covering ground<br />
Now, the P be pumping it up by tearing it down<br />
And y'all love this sound, it goes... to the... ay-yo...<br />
<br />
[Double K:] (Uh, bust it out, string it up)<br />
Gettin' busy like a hi-top fade<br />
I rock to get better for the letter, the P<br />
The go-getter of fresh shit, Double and the Peruvian<br />
The ones you should mess with, we mess with funky loops<br />
We go together like toast and orange juice<br />
Made American hang loose, broke up the gang truce<br />
Stolen the Spruce Goose and got fly on 'em, Columbian neck-tie on 'em<br />
Pumpin' like a new modem, rhymes, I wrote 'em in color<br />
In every letter with a difference, they say that I'm splendiferous<br />
In your peripher-ence, but I stay out of sight<br />
Put a citation on your microphone, so leave Mike alone when he doing his thang<br />
And here in the big bang, heard Parliament sang:<br />
&quot;If you hear any noise, it's me and the boys&quot;<br />
Just getting drunk and doing what we known for<br />
For Fort Collins and Sactown, back down to San Dog<br />
It's your man and them, brought a clan with them<br />
Back for the first time, equivalent to crime in the streets<br />
Out of control like wild teenagers and pagers<br />
Swearing in the name of your savior<br />
I get funky like Deuteronomy, no one ever be harming me<br />
MCs be taunting me, but I strike down from the heavens of dopeness<br />
You can quote this, tell 'em I'm in every word and verb<br />
I'm smashing kids with adjectives, no additives<br />
Them niggas are pro now, it's like &quot;Oh, wow! ([Thes One:] Ay-yo, tearin' it down, and...)<br />
You motherfukers did it again!&quot; Uh! (Fo sho... to the...)<br />
<br />
Ay-yo, pump me up, man, we're covering ground<br />
Now, the P be pumping it up by tearing it down<br />
And y'all love this sound, it goes... to the...<br />
Ay-yo, pump me up, yo, we're covering ground<br />
Now, the P be pumping it up by tearing it down<br />
And y'all love this sound, it goes... to the...<br />
Ay-yo, pump me up, yo, we're covering ground<br />
Now, the P be pumping it up by tearing it down<br />
And y'all love this sound, it goes... to the...<br />
Ay-yo, pump me up, yo, we're covering ground<br />
Yup, we're covering ground, yup, we're covering ground<br />
So get down... it's turfbuilding.<br />
<br />
([Thes One:] Thes to the rescue... cuttin' through grass and all that jazz... Double K... yeah, he's fertilizing... he's fertilizing... mow that shit... fertilize... a little sprinklers...them Toros in the ground...</p>
