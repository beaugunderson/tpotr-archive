<h1>The Double K Show</h1> 
<p><strong>Written by: Michael Turner &amp; Christopher Portugal</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>[Thes One:] It's not turntablism (it's hip hop)… it's not turntablism (it's hip hop)…it's just… what it is…<br />
<br />
[Rap sample:] Who gives a fuck about a goddamn <span class="grey-text">tramp</span>?<br />
[Rap sample:] Anyway<br />
<br />
[Thes One:]<br />
You got a DJ, I guess that's nice<br />
He practices stunts while mine rolls fat blunts<br />
And dices the ones and twos, Double K troubling crews<br />
That can't understand the way his hands move<br />
God-given gift of being swift on the tables<br />
Try and copy his cuts, you're nuts, you're not able<br />
The RCA cable can barely transmit it<br />
Stepping using his weapons, you're tripping, kid, forget it!<br />
'Cause he can keep it on-beat, tranforming quicker<br />
And serve that ass like a cold glass of hard liquor<br />
The Jack Tripper, probably even rock the Regal Beagle<br />
As Double works a needle like a sweatshop illegal<br />
I've seen him rock a wedding and everybody left sweatin'<br />
He did it in a DMC 'cause those kids be forgetting<br />
It's not about a routine but how well you rock<br />
From touring overseas to gangster parties on the block<br />
He's a one man, comparable to thunder<br />
You see him before you hear him, and that's why crews fear him<br />
A big motherfucker controlling the ones and twos<br />
Fat black DJ like them old school <span class="grey-text">crews</span><br />
<br />
[Rap sample:] This is for your little weak DJs<br />
[Rap sample:] The one that talk shit while your records skip<br />
[Rap sample:] This is for your little weak DJs<br />
[Rap sample:] You're fucked up with wack scratching <span class="grey-text">can I say</span><br />
[Rap sample:] This is for your little weak DJs<br />
[Rap sample:] <span class="grey-text">Give up your pendulum, punk</span><br />
[Rap sample:] Grab a pen, take notes<br />
[Rap sample:] Ah-Ah-Ow!<br />
[Rap sample:] This is for your little…<br />
[Rap sample:] Motherfucker!<br />
<br />
[Double K:]<br />
Now, I'm the mack-aroni of the two techniques<br />
Still chilling like Norman Rogers with my hands I speak (The Terminator!)<br />
I'm never hamster using, I'm crossfader bruising<br />
Slip mats and hard liquors be the tools that I'm using<br />
DJs ([Spoken sample:] Gather round!), check out the way it gets done<br />
I don't need no headphones, they get in my way, son<br />
So, wa-wa-watch me get busy like a tied-up phone line<br />
Ay-yo, it's DJ Double K, I said I'm going for mine (You know that!)<br />
<br />
[Rap sample:] The <span class="grey-text">freak get</span>, go ahead, might get kinda funky<br />
[Rap sample:] Get a little something <span class="grey-text">ta-take beyond</span><br />
He's gonna rock the place, and he has the bass, up in my face<br />
[Rap sample:] Yeah! Up, down, and all around a crossfader<br />
[Rap sample:] Yeah! Up, down, and all around a crossfader<br />
[Rap sample:] Of the cuts on the… <span class="grey-text">turn tough</span>!<br />
[Rap sample:] Yeah! Up, down, and all around a crossfader<br />
[Spoken sample:] I had to hold it between both my <span class="grey-text">legs</span>…<br />
[Rap sample:] Yeah! Up, down, and all around a crossfader<br />
[Spoken sample:] He's just about ready to do that thing<br />
[Spoken sample:] Can I- Can I get in- Can I get into the thing, really? (Yeah!)<br />
[Rap sample:] Yeah, ha huh ha, huh ha huh ha ha, huh ha huh ha ha ha!<br />
[Rap sample:] <span class="grey-text">Never all people, sucka can't get ahead</span><br />
[Rap sample:] Stepping into the scene, waxing and taxing New Jacks<br />
[Rap sample:] Your DJs had it, we're terminating this <span class="grey-text">?</span> shit<br />
[Rap sample:] Ease back<br />
[Rap sample:] And come again with some different shit<br />
[Spoken sample:] Wait a minute<br />
[Rap sample:] Transform<br />
[Spoken sample:] Wait a minute<br />
[Rap sample:] It's like jack<br />
[Spoken sample:] Wait a minute<br />
[Rap sample:] It's like… it's like jack<br />
[Spoken sample:] Wait a minute<br />
[Rap sample:] Get up<br />
[Rap sample:] Cut the jam!<br />
[Spoken sample:] Wait a minute<br />
[Rap sample:] Get up… get up<br />
[Rap sample:] Get up<br />
[Rap sample:] Cut the jam!<br />
[Rap sample:] Everybody in the place!<br />
[Spoken sample:] Wait a minute<br />
[Rap sample:] Everybody in the place!<br />
[Spoken sample:] Wait a minute<br />
<br />
[Rap sample:] West Side in effect! (repeated and scratched)<br />
<br />
[Spoken sample:] Shit! Ooh, this… is… a… nice… mother… fucker!<br />
[Spoken sample:] I could take a little bit more of this good motherfucker…</p>
