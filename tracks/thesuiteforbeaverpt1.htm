<h1>The Suite For Beaver, Pt. 1</h1> 
<p><strong>Written by: Michael Turner &amp; Christopher Portugal</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>[Roscoe (Double K):] Mike! Mike! Pick up the phone, man! This is Roscoe! Down here at the club, punk… come on, man, I'm throwing a party tonight, man, you got to be there, man, I don't want to hear none of that shit, man, we gonna have the ladies, we gonna have a whole lotta drinks… we gonna clean your table off for you too, man… I told your boy, he said he was coming down there, man, just… get on into it, man, you know… don't be sitting around, looking like you a clown, man, get on down here and party down, shit… see you later, man…<br />
<br />
[Little Beaver sample:] Get into the party life… uh huh… uh huh…<br />
([Double K:] Listen to that old man… I'm not trying to party shit, man, I'm trying to go chill, man… get another smoke on, <span class="grey-text">go</span> make a couple beats, man, <span class="grey-text">ain't</span> going out there <span class="grey-text">or no</span> shit… you know what I'm saying, man… don't even feel like partying, man, just… the last time I partied, man, mo'fucker was throwing up, mo'fucker was fighting and bullshit… the DJ was wack… man… I'll just party by myself, man, you know what I'm saying? Sit back here, man, just chill out and smoke a little dope… maybe I'll just chill out, hear this nigga Thes One, and see what's going on a little later, you know? What? I'mma take the trash out in a minute, man! Leave me alone!)<br />
<br />
[Double K:]<br />
I live an analog lifestyle, sometimes it's wild<br />
I wake up to see the sun, to hear my thoughts start to pile up<br />
Man, it's rough being a young cool man<br />
Don't wanna hear nobody trying to tell me what they thinking and<br />
<span class="grey-text">Faking</span> and shamming, thinking that they're jamming <span class="grey-text">and not</span><br />
It's a hot day, so I proceed to go my way<br />
Out of contact, turn up the beats and start to zone out<br />
The phone was ringing (bling bling), I knocked the phone out<br />
I'm 'bout to bone out, I need a little ism for my Friday<br />
Hit my nigga up, told him I'm on my way<br />
But before I got where I was going, pager started flowing<br />
This freak from around the way, the bitch was mind-blowing<br />
But no time for her, I'm on some cool-out shit<br />
Copped my bag, hit the pad, sit back, and watch the <span class="grey-text">locs</span> flip<br />
I'm in the middle of a head-nod, when all of a sudden<br />
The power went off, soon as I hit the kick button<br />
Now, Double K ain't afraid of no ghost<br />
And I know I ain't tripping on this Bombay smoke<br />
I'm about to post to keep blowing 'til my mind is shut<br />
But yo… that was real weed right there…</p>
<p>[Thes One:] It's been one of those weeks, stressing frequently<br />
Scrounging up money, paying rent and DWP<br />
My girl mood-swinging, acting funny, didn't test her<br />
Left for the studio but broke a compressor (Damn!)<br />
Rocked the show on Tuesday, promoter didn't pay me<br />
Said, &quot;Y'all never work again in this here city of L.A.&quot;<br />
So the middle finger I flipped, and then my jeans ripped<br />
I ordered Jumbo Jack, but they gave me fish and chips<br />
That was last night, and now I'm, like, ready to drink<br />
Forget the dirty laundry and the dishes in the sink<br />
'Cause the party life is like nothing else<br />
And if you got a lot of problems, put your shit on the shelf<br />
And let yourself go, I felt no worries as I slid out<br />
South to Crescent Heights, where the Double stayed hid out<br />
On the block, and I arrive, walking, jive talking,<br />
Slap a low five, it's time for the party life.<br />
<br />
[Little Beaver sample:] Get into the party life… uh huh… uh huh…<br />
([Double K:] Yeah, you know, I'm 'bout to go rap tonight, me and Chris… yeah, Chris that I rap with… yeah, that guy… yeah, we gon- we, we gonna go on out to this club tonight, probably hang out, I'll be home a little later on… yeah, yeah I fed the dogs… yeah… yeah, I cleaned up… yeah, I put it- okay… oh yeah, I'll be back… yeah, we partying tonight! We partying, alright? I'll see you later…)<br />
<br />
[Thes One:] What up, Double? ([Double K:] 'Sup?)<br />
Yeah, that's a dope beat<br />
Man, I heard there was a spot popping off down the street (Word?)<br />
We could crash and smash a free Long &quot;I&quot; Ice Tea<br />
Heard the bartender is a fan of the P<br />
[Double K:] Hahhh, sounds like a mother, my brother<br />
Let me get my smash jeans, make sure my t-shirt's clean<br />
We can ride up the block, top choice with big hats<br />
I'm steady sipping here and mumbling &quot;Man, what's that?&quot;<br />
[Thes One:] I think I hit a little something just to wet my whistle<br />
Don't touch the Silver Bullet, I'm drinking the Miller Missile<br />
And I reminisce a little 'bout the days of old<br />
When I used to drink it all down, or so I'm told<br />
But whatever, I start the car, raise the break lever, never swerve<br />
Pull up to the club, we hit the curb.<br />
[Little Beaver sample:] Get into the party life…<br />
[Thes One:] It went… [vocal screech noise]<br />
[Double K:] Damn, man, what the fuck you doing, man? <span class="grey-text">Cool deal.</span><br />
[Thes One:] And the ladies say…<br />
[Little Beaver sample:] Get into the party life…<br />
<br />
[Double K:] You know? Shit, he drinking and driving, boy, you know how we do it, man. We gonna go on in there and cool out, you know?<br />
([Thes One:] Yeah, yeah, yeah…)<br />
[Double K:] Yeah?<br />
([Thes One:] Yeah, alright, man…)<br />
[Double K:] You got your wallet?<br />
([Thes One:] Yeah, I got it, man…<br />
[Roscoe :] Hey, hey!)<br />
[Double K:] Yeah, man… you saw them Lakers yesterday, right?<br />
([Thes One:] Hahaha!)<br />
[Double K:] Ha-ha! We- go over there…<br />
[Roscoe:] Hey, Mike! Hey, what's up, Mike and Chris? What's going down, man?<br />
[Double K:] Haaa… hey, nigga… what's up, boy? <span class="grey-text">??</span><br />
[Roscoe:] Aw, man, you know, I've just been doing it tonight… right, fellas? We got these drinks in here, we got these ladies and tables all cleaned off, man. Let's come in here and party tonight, man. Come on.<br />
[Spoken sample:] I can dig it. What's going down, bro?<br />
<br />
[Double K:] Yeah, woo! Look at those girls! Sound like it's about to get going down up in here, huh? Yo yo! Yeah, go get some drink.</p>
