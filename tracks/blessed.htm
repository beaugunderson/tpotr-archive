<h1>Blessed<font size="1"><strong>(Sam Spade)</strong></font></h1>
<p><strong>Written by: Marlowe, Michael Turner &amp; Christopher Portugal</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>[Sam Spade:]<br />
Everybody's blessed physically, as well as mentally<br />
The mental was the utensil for the brain, <span class="grey-text">see motional</span> activity<br />
Spiritually controlling me on the essence to rise<br />
My brown eyes can seek <span class="grey-text">a fine ache</span>, it's advised to save your life<br />
The devil tries to tempt by keeping your soul with lives to control<br />
Savaged my cabbage, <span class="grey-text">due to the cage</span>, we funking some more<br />
Projecting my thoughts to be on point like it was a cactus<br />
<span class="grey-text">Maintaining shit would've been my spiritual rim<br />
It doesn't form madness (Stroked my cabbage)</span><br />
<br />
And I felt the stun just by being punished<br />
The infliction of a better side of life<br />
Said I could accomplish anything I want<br />
<span class="grey-text">But it wasn't afford to head from my neck to hold</span><br />
It was more like a standard the ones that <br />
<span class="grey-text">Got reached before we get home</span><br />
Never gray-haired and never being misled by the two-horned head<br />
Conflicted collision, <span class="grey-text">open turned I plucking my vision</span><br />
In the degree of my naked eye, I spy to the atmosphere<br />
Description of a double-O-7 reverend <span class="grey-text">preaching up like a phony gear</span><br />
And after the sermon, I'm yearning for the brain cells to be burning<br />
Won't control a substance of hip, rolled up with the blunt<br />
That you can't handle, stability <span class="grey-text">even below doses</span> I quote this<br />
Punctuate the beginning, my focus, that's lyrical dopeness<br />
Tablet unwrapped, plus intoxicated minds sporadic<br />
<span class="grey-text">Biters</span> like to show static, become the weak fanatic in my attic<br />
Thoughts called about confusion, once the inclusion<br />
I must have <span class="grey-text">print</span> like I was in a log case, bleeding, guilty<br />
Losing the battle, between me and the Queen<br />
She was a supreme, <span class="grey-text">varying toast</span> of my dream, of black complexion<br />
<span class="grey-text">Of morning jumped kingdom, you really be down on earth<br />
As a neck</span>, feeling emotions like counting plannings at seven<br />
With the fortunate unit referred to <span class="grey-text">as sucka he</span> couldn't touch me<br />
To the man <span class="grey-text">that pretend he professes to exterm<br />
In my flow hand</span> is some Hennessey, even both into the Depression<br />
Writers block his temple with my profession<br />
When the collect <span class="grey-text">shum</span> show a session<br />
Three strikes already connected like they come moving and feeling<br />
They can imagine your supreme <span class="grey-text">into drummer</span> and they avoid it<br />
Still, projecting my thoughts to be on point like it was a cactus<br />
<span class="grey-text">Maintaining shit would've been my spiritual rim<br />
It doesn't form madness</span><br />
<br />
Yo, yo, check it out: everybody's blessed physically, as well as mentally<br />
The mental was the utensil for the brain, <span class="grey-text">see motional</span> activity<br />
Spiritually controlling me on the essence to rise<br />
My brown eyes can seek <span class="grey-text">a fine ache</span>, it's advised to save your life<br />
The devil tries to tempt by keeping your soul with lives to control<br />
Savaged my cabbage, <span class="grey-text">due to the cage</span>, we funking some more<br />
Projecting my thoughts to be on point like it was a cactus<br />
<span class="grey-text">Maintaining shit would've been my spiritual rim<br />
It doesn't form madness</span><br />
<br />
My designated average, yo, on the Saturday, Latter-Day Saints<br />
<span class="grey-text">Some pat is my pliance, some llama empire, religion's liar</span><br />
Ain't got the desired time for clocking the rhyme, y'all want to be talking<br />
<span class="grey-text">Just through the beats in</span>, turned up my Walkman and kept walking<br />
'Til I entered the down low, <span class="grey-text">black, low</span>, and to the petite store<br />
And so I residence so I represent my president's getting spent<br />
By helping the next man pay his rent, maintain the lie<br />
So I decorated the <span class="grey-text">printed air press</span>, covered my homie <span class="grey-text">before</span><br />
That's spinning the tracks, ears irritated for the wax<br />
Trained, it was straining, went straight to the limo<br />
Just claiming MCs lieutenant<br />
With the splendid, <span class="grey-text">bended</span> for the mic so <span class="grey-text">let's straight to the cent</span><br />
Circle the game open wouldn't have fret my image<br />
If it end up the scrimmage for the gimmick game<br />
Compared to the hostiles, <span class="grey-text">weak alum train</span><br />
Without any confusion to add the contusion to my brain<br />
Stepped out of the frame, shorty steps up, displays the name<br />
It should have been illustrated for achieving in the Hall of Fame<br />
'Cause it was <span class="grey-text">average</span>, but the way that she carried it was extravagant<br />
Lacking in moderation, extremely becoming <span class="grey-text">he's average</span><br />
So it wasn't a problem at first, <span class="grey-text">I seem for the</span> rather that worst<br />
But you know what happens <span class="grey-text">when no active is just burst</span><br />
We used to <span class="grey-text">never share</span> the root of the problem<br />
Calculate the brain <span class="grey-text">with meant matters</span> that have all been solved<br />
With the depression dissolves the compassion, lost the battle<br />
Seems like victory wasn't meant to be<br />
<span class="grey-text">Hunted</span> together with wisdom, you got a fraction unintentionally<br />
Mainly, my prediction was, of course, <span class="grey-text">off battling</span> resource<br />
<span class="grey-text">Decked in the beer</span>, more rights? Naw, just bless the power <span class="grey-text">and force</span>!<br />
<br />
Everybody's blessed physically, as well as mentally<br />
The mental was the utensil for the brain, <span class="grey-text">see motional</span> activity<br />
Spiritually controlling me on the essence to rise<br />
My brown eyes can seek <span class="grey-text">a fine ache</span>, it's advised to save your life<br />
The devil tries to tempt by keeping your soul with lives to control<br />
Savaged my cabbage, <span class="grey-text">due to the cage</span>, we funking some more<br />
Projecting my thoughts to be on point like it was a cactus<br />
<span class="grey-text">Maintaining shit would've been my spiritual rim<br />
It doesn't form madness</span><br />
Spiritually mad!</p>
