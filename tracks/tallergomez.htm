<h1>Taller Gomez <font size="1"><strong>(Bloquera)</strong></font></h1> 
<p><strong>Written by: Christopher Portugal, Alex Newman, Jamaan McLaren, Sir Kado &amp; Superbrush 427</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>[All:]<br />
Hey, have you heard of Taller Gomez? (Yeah.)<br />
Oh yeah, I know you know Taller Gomez (Yeah, yeah, yeah.)<br />
Tell me have you heard of Taller Gomez<br />
Oh yeah, I know you know Taller Gomez<br />
<br />
[Maanumental:]<br />
In the history of Baja, never a larger Latino<br />
I heard he got his weight up with the mega three aminos<br />
Born and raised in Santa Rosalia to a man that ran a panaderia<br />
Knocked his mother up and said &quot;See ya!&quot;<br />
Out he goes, adios, he was on his own with Mom<br />
She brought him up right, so he stood tallest of <span class="grey-text">alls</span><br />
Played baseball, football, was always into something<br />
Chompin' on ceviche when a DJ came bumpin'<br />
Into town, Armando, Nando for short<br />
And Taller dropped his jaw as he watched him hold court<br />
Rockin' on the mic, pumpin' up the discoteca<br />
Sayin' &quot;Ah, dios mio! Boy, it's just so fresca!&quot;<br />
The DJ stayed extra days, they played <span class="grey-text">zesca</span><br />
Showed him how to rock the stage fresher<br />
And blessed him with a jacket made of leather<br />
That said &quot;<span class="grey-text">Def home</span>&quot; on it<br />
Even gave him his name, and you know he grew to own it<br />
Soon enough, he blew up, hoping for el supergroupo Menudo<br />
Had the honeys barking like a chucho<br />
He left town with them and the legend extended<br />
Up above to the man we all know and love<br />
A couple years ago, hit the road to San Quintin<br />
Gave the jacket back to Nando when he saw him on the scene<br />
Heard he tore the loc up and <span class="grey-text">pimped</span> him down that night<br />
And you can ask, all the townies <span class="grey-text">babble</span> when you wanna pass, like<br />
<br />
[All:]<br />
Tell me have you heard of Taller Gomez<br />
Oh yeah, I know you know Taller Gomez (Yeah, yeah.)<br />
<br />
[Newman:]<br />
I heard his father played banda, in the band he was a tubist<br />
Can't recall the group's name, but the people called him Brutus<br />
His mother was Francesca, a fancy French nudist<br />
And as a tourist, they met in Cabo San Lucas<br />
They fell in love, and he quickly quit the band<br />
She sold off all her jewels, and they bought a piece of land<br />
Santa Rosalia was the place, and soon Fran<br />
Was seen walking down the sand naked, gettin' tan<br />
Brutus got a boat, and took a float every day<br />
He would catch some <span class="grey-text">otta</span> fish from France and filet<br />
But on the day that Taller was born, I'm sad to say<br />
That his father took a trip and his ship lost the way<br />
So his mother raised Taller on her own<br />
They were really poor, his only toy: a microphone<br />
She would work all day, and he'd be all alone<br />
Just him and his mic until he found a book of poems<br />
It was lying by a racket and a black satin jacket<br />
He looked around frantic, he got ready to nab it<br />
A voice came behind him, and said, &quot;Yo, you can have it!&quot;<br />
He wore a hat and glasses, Taller thought he was magic<br />
The man showed Taller what the mic was for<br />
Taller tried it out, and the magic man was floored<br />
Before the man left, he told Taller to perform<br />
And he took his advice, and that night, a star was born<br />
He rocked every block from TJ to Santiago<br />
Tapes would pop up from London to Chicago<br />
Castro had him for lunch at the height of the embargo<br />
And he went triple platinum with his <span class="grey-text">samp yo soy ilmargo</span><br />
But soon after that, he changed name, became devout<br />
Catholic and went to Mexico to hide out<br />
But if you ever drive through Baja, watch out<br />
For a black satin jacket, if you see it, then shout:<br />
<br />
[All:]<br />
Hey, have you heard of Taller Gomez?<br />
Oh yeah, I know you know Taller Gomez<br />
(Yeah, I know Taller… check it out…) (Yeah, yeah.)<br />
<br />
[Thes One:]<br />
One day, in San Ignacio, an orphan was found<br />
In front of the mission, who said his dad was out trigger fishing<br />
In Santa Rosalia, but never returned home<br />
They say his boat might've sunk, but it's just not known<br />
Now, anyways, Taller spent many days alone<br />
In which time, I guess he learned how to rock a microphone<br />
The townspeople did what they could and gave him a home<br />
An old Def Jam jacket, and a ten peso loan<br />
But soon that was gone, so he wrote a song he could sing<br />
For the tourists coming to town the following Spring<br />
His show was so live that when they arrived, they were amazed<br />
By an eight year old rapper with a hi-top fade<br />
Word spread, and soon the people came from all around<br />
To hear that young Latin rapper with the much Taller sound<br />
Now, if my memory serves me, it was 1984<br />
A good twenty years before his first world tour<br />
He was then fourteen and hanging down by the lake<br />
When the older kids offered him some fresh tricky trakes<br />
After that, he started blowing up and headed for the coast<br />
But too many of them cookies started stunting his growth<br />
He met DJ Fat Pepper in a San  Quintin cantina<br />
Spinnin' for Latinas and dancing the Macarena<br />
They hooked up and became a team, but on the down low<br />
Taller's addiction was worsening, it would shatter their dream<br />
A night before their biggest show, he was found<br />
In the green room, facedown in tricky trake cookie dough<br />
The next day, Baja cried 'cause Taller had died<br />
A microphone shrine was built where he used to reside<br />
But between me and you, I don't think he's really dead<br />
Here's a little information Old Man Taco bled<br />
[Thes One, with Old Man Taco (?) on the help out:]<br />
He said that Taller's still alive, and his legend lives on<br />
And sometimes, late at night, you can still hear his song<br />
He said:<br />
[Old Man Taco (?):] Like a whisper in a pass<br />
[Thes One:] The old man did say…<br />
[Old Man Taco (?):] <span class="grey-text">try carrying</span> southbound to Mulegé…</p>
