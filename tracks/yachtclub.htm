<h1>Yacht Club</h1> 
<p><strong>Written by: Christopher Portugal</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>[Thes One:] You know, when I'm not out performing San Francisco Knights with my posse, I enjoy playing the stock market, driving my rally car, and taking the yacht out of the yard most of all… check it out…<br />
<br />
Cruising down the bay like an Old Man Loot<br />
Laid back, Bird Larry tie, rocking a suit<br />
You might think I was a good friend of Al Capone<br />
Eating scones on a yacht while talking on cell phones<br />
Got a white lounge chair with a suit to match<br />
Golden-bordered anchor on the captain's hat<br />
GPS, they can't trace Thes unless<br />
You got an address, need to repress the test<br />
Got a lathe in a sea-cave with no fleas<br />
In the sand off my land in the West Indies<br />
([Spoken sample:] So I got that..), and we can fix the skip<br />
Jump back on the ship, head back to the slip<br />
Cut an extra dub plate for my yacht club mates<br />
So we can bump it up late while we throw down eights<br />
Playing Gin, drinking gin, eating shark's fin soup<br />
Dropping classic hip hop and playing &quot;Name That Loop&quot;<br />
It's just a lifestyle I'm living 'cause I'm trying to get mine<br />
'Cause being broke all the time sucks<br />
([Spoken sample:] That's right, it sucks!)<br />
It's just a lifestyle I'm dreaming 'cause I deserve mine<br />
I'm tired of this underground grind<br />
<br />
But, hey, you wanna exist that way? ([Spoken sample:] Okay, fine!)<br />
I wanna live life to the fullest and get mine<br />
Not riding the bus with hip hop on my mind<br />
Let's try to find the balance, yo, and raise the bottom line<br />
But you wanna exist that way? ([Spoken sample:] Okay, fine!)<br />
I'll get what's mine, and you can do it for the love<br />
I just hope you got a plan, man, when push come to shove<br />
([Spoken sample:] When you're finished…<br />
Why don't you drop by the yacht club?)<br />
<br />
While me and the Judge'll be sitting, getting shoe shines<br />
Removing a smudge, reminiscing 'bout good times<br />
Like the eighty year regatta and a debutante ball<br />
Placed third overall, <span class="grey-text">tennised up</span> last fall<br />
It's all known, I hit the bathroom, it's all chrome<br />
Got the Johnson's baby powder and the Polo cologne<br />
Yes, fresh dressed, like a million bucks<br />
Throw on the Bally shoes, tip the dude five bucks<br />
Hey, stepped out the bathroom door ([Rap sample:] Oh no!)<br />
Runnin' late for my tee time date, it's at four<br />
Just enough time to get the golf cart front line<br />
A pint of hefeweizen and a twist of lime<br />
I shot par, let's tell the valet to get the car<br />
Back to the yacht club, so we can chill at the bar<br />
I got an open tab, crack a crab leg, you can have<br />
Whatever you want, it's a five-star restaurant<br />
([Spoken sample:] Top notch! Top notch!)<br />
Let's not watch while they get fat<br />
Off this hip hop, and all we get is some props<br />
Some a-y'all are too satisfied with pats on the ass<br />
([Spoken sample:] Well, I'll tell you what's real satisfying: cash!)<br />
<br />
Yo, you wanna exist that way? ([Spoken sample:] Okay, fine!)<br />
I wanna live life to the fullest and get mine<br />
Not riding the bus with hip hop on my mind<br />
Let's try to find the balance, y'all, and raise the bottom line<br />
But you wanna exist that way? ([Spoken sample:] Okay, fine!)<br />
I'll get what's mine, and you can do it for the love<br />
I just hope you got a plan, 'cause when push come to shove<br />
([Spoken sample:] When you're finished…<br />
Why don't you drop by the yacht club?)<br />
<br />
[Spoken sample:]<br />
[Lacey Underall:] Looks like you're gonna make a lot of money when you're older.<br />
[Danny Noonan:] Yeah? When? How?<br />
[Lacey Underall:] Could be in the market… or on a gameshow!<br />
<br />
[Thes One:] To all you little hip hop dudes…<br />
[Spoken sample:] No offense!<br />
[Thes One:] I know it's not about the money…<br />
[Spoken sample:] No offense!<br />
[Thes One:] I know it's really <span class="grey-text">in this</span> for the love<br />
[Spoken sample:] No offense!<br />
[Thes One:] …but…<br />
[Spoken sample:] When you're finished…<br />
Why don't you drop by the yacht club?<br />
<br />
[Spoken sample:] So I got that..<br />
<br />
[Spoken sample:] When you're finished…<br />
Why don't you drop by the yacht club?</p>
