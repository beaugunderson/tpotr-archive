<h1>Doctor Feelgood</h1> 
<p><strong>Written by: Michael Turner &amp; Christopher Portugal</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>[Double K:] (Oh, ho ho! Aite...)<br />
Young, black and proud, with plenty to live for<br />
Toast up or roll up, turn the beat up more<br />
I thank god that I'm livin', another day given<br />
My ambition is somehow to make a difference<br />
Through the way that I talk, a negative to positive<br />
Beats, rhymes and life: that's the way that I live<br />
It could've been death row, it could've been skid<br />
The city I come from get vicious like Sid<br />
I feel good, and never take shit for granted<br />
And every day feels like the Mothership landed<br />
We all on the one, like a crash and a kick<br />
Got the kids all smilin', magician trick<br />
Promoter payout, and we landin' safe<br />
Another time, another day, and we all embrace<br />
Like the homies in the hood, let me make it overstood<br />
Every minute that you're breathin', ride on and feel good<br />
<br />
[Sung sample:]<br />
He's the one they call Dr. Feelgood<br />
He's the one that makes ya feel all right ([Spoken sample:] Alright, alright!)<br />
He's the one they call Dr. Feelgood<br />
He's the one that makes ya feel all right ([Spoken sample:] Alright, alright!)<br />
<br />
[Thes One:]<br />
Today, I woke up and saw the sun shinin' through<br />
Jumped up and took a hot shower, made me feel brand new<br />
Like when I was a kid and swingin' on a rope swing<br />
Let go, Merced River, Yosemite, camping in Lower Pines<br />
I lower rhymes like vines to slower times and split limes in Pacifico<br />
'Cause life's not so difficult if you could just let go of the typical crap<br />
And free your mind and just align with our rap<br />
So now we been around the world and made the people say &quot;Awww, shit!&quot;<br />
To free your mind of hardship and let your psyche unzip<br />
And open up and hug someone, the most powerful drug is fun and fully free<br />
The Fun DMC rap music, enthuse it, we abuse it<br />
The P'll keep it goin' so that you could never lose it<br />
The U.S.A. tradition? It's rap abolition<br />
So free your mind and find yourself a half-full position<br />
'Cause we be the doctor...<br />
<br />
[Sung sample:] Feelgood<br />
He's the one that makes ya feel all right<br />
He's the one they call Dr. Feelgood<br />

<br />
[Man #1:] Haha. Yeah.<br />
[Man #2:] If these seem like good times to you, then hook up with people like this.<br />
[Man #1:] Give us a call!<br />
[Man #3:] Exactly!
[Man #2:] Give them a call! They look like your kind of people...<br />
[Spoken sample:] I feel good!<br />
[Man #1:] Like your kind of people...<br />
[Spoken sample:] Thanks for being with us. I guess we're gonna hear lots more. (Hasta luego!) Okay, hasta luego to you, too. Bye now. Thank you for being with us today. One of the nice things about this program is... we're flexible! We kinda go with the flow of what's happening at the moment. Hope you will too, but stay safe... Won't you look both ways. We'll look for you again tomorrow. Goodbye, now.<br />
<br />
[Thes One:] And all the people say: ([Double K:] Oh!)<br />
Uh, fo sho! (Fo sho!) Fo sho! (Fo sho!) Fo sho! (Fo sho!) [repeats]<br />
([Sung sample:] He's the one they call Dr. Feelgood<br />
He's the one that makes ya feel all right)<br />
<br />
[Spoken sample:] Looks ready to me!</p>
