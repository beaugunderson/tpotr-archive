<h1>Cool Story Bro</h1> 
<p><strong>Written by: Michael Turner &amp; Christopher Portugal</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>[Sung sample:] Just a shot, just a shot in the...<br />
[Spoken sample:] Last night, near the intersection of Compton and Imperial Highway in South L.A.... At this point, the boy is reportedly still in the care of the Department of Child and Family Services...<br />
[Double K:] Yo, man... Won't belive it, man. Pssh, L.A., man, let me tell you, man. Some shit happened the other night when I was trying to get right, man. Check this out, dude. Yo...<br />
<br />
[Double K:]<br />
Cold Friday night with nothing to do<br />
Just took my last shot and it's a quarter to two<br />
Gotta hit the liquor store before they close, ya dig?<br />
It's right up the block, so stroll I did<br />
Threw on my windbreaker, blue L.A. hat<br />
Been here since '77, no need for the gat<br />
Got the roach out the ashtray, proceded to bail<br />
Nigga went, right behind was the hydro smell<br />
Walked through the front door, big grin on my mug<br />
'Cause it's the weekend, and Double's 'bout to get fucked up<br />
Passed the alcohol and headed straight for the snacks<br />
When I glanced towards La Cienega and noticed some blacks<br />
But I ain't trippin', not Bloodin' or Cripin'<br />
The only thing on my mind is the 'liks I'll be sippin'<br />
That's when it hit me like bricks: damn, they wearin' all red<br />
My neighborhood is blue, and it's fuckin' with my head<br />
Slowly and cautious, I went to make my purchase<br />
That's when I turned around and seen a nigga with a purpose<br />
Tattoos on his face and the devil in his eye<br />
Whoever he was looking for that night was gonna die<br />
<br />
[Rap sample:] Now tell me what the fuck am I supposed to do?<br />
<br />
[Thes One:]<br />
Friday night, party off Hoover and Adams<br />
Couple SC students, couple fly Latin madams<br />
But I wasn't mad at 'em, rap music on the stereo<br />
Me and Mike smokin' pinners, drinkin' on the patio<br />
Oh shit, time to go, here come the Harpies<br />
Ducked out the back gate, diggin' for my car keys<br />
God, please let us get away from this with quickness<br />
Gangs don't ask, they just blast first with no witness<br />
Found the car parked on Oak, made a right on 23rd<br />
Another right on Hoover, got away safe ([Double K:] Yeah, word.)<br />
But what's that? LAPD now following me<br />
Play it cool, take off your hat and drive slowly<br />
We're just some homies, they're calling homeboys<br />
Saw another cruiser creepin', pullin' out the Pep Boys parking lot<br />
My hands start sweatin', I'm forgettin' that I'm innocent<br />
Thoughts startin' racin' 'bout jettin'<br />
But we play it cool, left turn, 10 West on-ramp<br />
Ten cars follow now... man, they won't fall back<br />
The freeway, six lanes, empty in the dead of night<br />
Hit with the flash of the helicopter spotlight<br />
Twenty sirens in my rearview lit up, too<br />
Now, tell me what the fuck am I supposed to do?<br />
<br />
[Spoken sample:] People more afraid of the police 'cause they got guns<br />
[Rap sample:] Now tell me what the fuck am I supposed to do?<br />
[Spoken sample:] When police can get the person alone...<br />
[Rap sample:] Now tell me what the fuck am I supposed to do?<br />
<br />
[Double K:]<br />
&quot;Ay... Ay, homie, where you from?&quot;, I'm not a gang-banger<br />
Just known around the hood as the funky rap slanger<br />
At this, I see the bulge in his waist<br />
Acted kinda fidgety with confusion on his face<br />
I went about my business, paid for the Ketel One<br />
They still posted outside, I shoulda brought my gun<br />
But I'm not one to run, so I grabbed my bag<br />
Made some eye contact, and headed left towards the pad<br />
Waitin' to hear gunshots, I made it up the block safely<br />
I guess he had the blam on safety<br />
Now, here goes the lesson: when you hangin' in my city<br />
Beware, move correct, these kids got no pity<br />
<br />
[Thes One:]<br />
Spotlight through the night, shadows on the dashtop<br />
Megaphone, cop yells, &quot;Don't pull over, just stop.<br />
Now, put your hands up!&quot; They got their guns drawn<br />
&quot;Driver, exit slowly. One fast move, and you're gone.&quot;<br />
I get out, turn around with hands in the air<br />
No tears, no fear, kneel down like I'm in deep prayer<br />
Handcuffed, face down in the third lane<br />
I look under the car, Double K's in mad pain<br />
But what we even do? No burner, no weapons<br />
Sour breath askin' me what gang Turner is reppin'<br />
And do I have a warrant? And is the car stolen?<br />
And if not, why the hell are me and him rollin'?<br />
I don't know, it's just my city, he my crew<br />
But tell me what the fuck am I supposed to do?<br />
<br />
[Spoken sample:] That's the way it is...<br />
[Rap sample:] Now tell me what the fuck am I supposed to do?<br />
[Rap sample:] Madness, insanity, livin' profanity<br />
Then some punk claimin' they're understandin' me?<br />
Give me a break! What world do you live in?<br />
Give me a break! What world do you live in?</p>
