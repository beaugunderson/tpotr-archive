<h1><em>Stepfather</em> Section Introduction</h1>
<p><strong>Written by: Michael Turner &amp; Christopher Portugal</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>([Blewfoot:] Yeah, my nigga, Double K.<br />
[Double K:] A little fuckin' KRS-One shit.<br />
[Blewfoot:] Yeah, so we do that shit, you know what I'm sayin'? Fuck this, you know what? Just gonna do it like that, then put them fours on the…)<br />
<br />
[Double K:] 1, 2, 3, 4, FIVE in your face, which was the <em>Stepfather</em> LP that we made, man…<br />
[Thes One:] 2006…<br />
[Double K:] 2006. One thing I wanna say is: that album was probably the hardest album to make because both of us was, like, &quot;yo, we gotta come way on the left on these dudes. We gotta stop doing the same thing because everybody was expecting the same thing from us.&quot;<br />
[Thes One:] Right.<br />
[Double K:] &quot;Where's your jazz loops? Where's your break beats?&quot;<br />
[Thes One:] Nah.<br />
[Double K:] We don't need all that to make music. Dig.<br />
[Thes One:] Right.<br />
[Double K:] Who was the feature that we had on that album?<br />
[Thes One:] None other than George Clinton. &quot;G Clinton&quot;, as he's credited on the album. All thanks to my man, honorary member of the Funk Mob, the US… shouldn't say &quot;honorary&quot;…<br />
[Double K:] The US….<br />
[Thes One:] Offical member of the US Funk Mob, Double K. And you know what the other thing about that is? That Blewfoot and everyone was down… here's the thing about <em>Stepfather</em>. The fans that we had that were down with <em>The Next Step</em>, a-and even <em>&quot;O.S.T.&quot;</em>… they were gone! They were a rap. These are a lot of dudes who say…<br />
[Double K:] Yeah, these dudes had kids!<br />
[Thes One:] &quot;I'm done with hip hop!&quot; They had kids. They were, like, &quot;We're done.&quot; And wh-and when we came back with <em>Stepfather</em>, it was like… the new… the Stepchildren… the new… the new…<br />
[Double K:] Yeah…<br />
[Thes One:] And we reintroduced ourselves with the newest and we came with the L.A.<br />
[Double K:] I know for… I know, we named the album &quot;<em>Stepfather</em>&quot; because, you know, it's like… Any kids out there watching this, any grown men who had a stepfather… you didn't listen to that dude. And we're the guys that you don't listen to. You like your father! And we're not your father. We're your Stepfather!<br />
[Thes One:] Right.<br />
[Double K:] So we made that, you know what I'm sayin'?<br />
[Thes One:] Yeah, like, the subtitle of the whole album was…<br />
[Double K:] Word.<br />
[Thes One:] It was an inside joke, it was… the album title…<br />
[Double K:] Every thing was an inside joke with us.<br />
[Thes One:] The album title was &quot;Stepfather: We're Trying But The Kids Won't Listen.&quot;<br />
<br />
[Thes One:] Did a little song, a little album, a little something called… yo…<br />
[Double K:] You are going down in history with us right now! It's <em>Stepfather</em>!<br />
[Thes One:] Isaiah, come out here, man.<br />
[Double K:] This is my little brother right here, y'all! This the future, right here.<br />
[Thes One:] Yo, you know how old he was when we made <em>The Next Step</em>? That big, brotha!<br />
[Double K:] You was that little, man.<br />
[Thes One:] You was that big.<br />
[Double K:] That's the little homie right here.</p>
