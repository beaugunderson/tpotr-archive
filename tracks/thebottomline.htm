<h1>The Bottom Line <font size="1" color="#aaaaaa"><strong>(unofficial title)</strong></font></h1> 
<p><strong>Written by: Michael Turner &amp; Christopher Portugal</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>[Double K:] Aw, shit…<br />
[Thes One:] Ha ha! Yeah!<br />
[Double K:] About that time…<br />
[Thes One:] Yeah, what time is it, man?<br />
[Double K:] I need some money!<br />
[Thes One:] Oh, for real? Yeah, well, we gonna make this Fun DMC, man. We gonna 'bout, uh, sell about eight units<br />
[Double K:] Man, tell me on this microphone, and rap about what we all like the best.<br />
[Thes One:] Selling LPs.<br />
[Double K:] Yeah, I like money, y'all.<br />
[Thes One:] You like money? Let's get on it. Huh!<br />
<br />
[Both &amp; rap sample:]The bottom line… <br />
[Double K:] What is it?<br />
[Both &amp; rap sample:] Is the dollar sign!<br />
[Thes One:] Now, check it out…<br />
[Both:] Said, you get yours, yo, and I'll get mine<br />
You get yours, yeah, and I'll get mine…<br />
[Thes One:] Uh, look out, y'all!<br />
[Rap sample:] The bottom line is the dollar sign!<br />
[Double K:] Step back, America, my money! My mean green dollar!<br />
<br />
[Double K:]<br />
Now, to my knowledge and understanding, we the ones in demand, and<br />
Commanding the tracks, manhandle wax when it's dug for<br />
I'm smoking when I'm on tour, the encore you blaze for<br />
I blaze more ([Thes One:] Blaze more!), before I can say more (Ha!)<br />
That's just the way I am, and that's the way that I rock<br />
Whether I'm chilling in London or slapping fives on the block<br />
Got soul like a mother, she rap like Pete's younger brother<br />
Fat boy wonder, putting bustas in a <span class="grey-text">slumber</span><br />
Keep me on the underground, you know I'm trying to get down<br />
From town to town, give all my peoples a pound<br />
Never complicated, keep it street-related, pro-faded<br />
For the junkies in the back, they be digging the cold rap<br />
And DJs across the land, yo, this one's for you<br />
Put a hole through your Vestax (Harassing your crew!)<br />
The Kings of Loops have arrived, live for the naked eye<br />
Trying to run and duplicate, well, my man why try? 'Cause, yo…<br />
<br />
[Both &amp; rap sample:]The bottom line… <br />
[Double K:] It's my money!<br />
[Both &amp; rap sample:] Is the dollar sign!<br />
[Double K:] My mean green dollar!<br />
[Thes One:] Now, check it out… you get yours, yo, and I'll get mine<br />
[Double K:] Yeah, don't touch it!<br />
[Thes One:] You get yours, yeah… Obama!<br />
[Double K:] Yo, look here…<br />
[Rap sample:] The bottom line<br />
[Thes One:] Yo mama!<br />
[Rap sample:] Is the dollar sign!<br />
[Double K:] My dollar! My mean green dollar! You get yours!<br />
[Thes One:] Check it out… b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-…<br />
<br />
[Thes One:]<br />
Raider of the lost art, cross-fader sage part<br />
In the lines of the rhyme with page, I make art<br />
Straight line, I write mine, auditory pipeline<br />
Lifeline, I'm living the ([Double K:] What!) in real-time<br />
Now the city sweats blood, if and when the moon shines<br />
The haze of mankind, loving its evil ways<br />
Days are no better, so your door unlock it<br />
I keep a 45 adaptor ride in your back pockets<br />
I walk streets, dig, eat, bump a new beat<br />
Take a time-zone tour, then I rest my feet<br />
The complete house party wrecker, the Black and the Deckers<br />
That Dust Busters, stand like Custer<br />
Last to catch the funk, blast the trust<br />
From the crates, so funkless can stand by the 8s<br />
Where it booms through their bones from here to nice homes<br />
See the P is the last one sitting on the throne<br />
Uh, look out, y'all!<br />
<br />
[Rap sample:] The bottom line<br />
[Thes One:] Uh, check it out<br />
[Double K:] Word!<br />
[Double K &amp; rap sample:] Is the dollar sign!<br />
[Thes One:] Uh, uh, yo!<br />
[Both &amp; rap sample:] I said, you get yours, yo, and I'll get mine<br />
You get yours, yo, and I'll get mine<br />
[Both:] Uh, look out, y'all!<br />
[Rap sample:] The bottom line<br />
[Double K:] get off my dollar!<br />
[Rap sample:] Is the dollar sign!<br />
[Double K:] My mean green dollar!<br />
[Thes One:] Check it out… you get yours, yo, and I'll get…<br />
[Both:] Mine<br />
[Thes One:] You get yours, yo!<br />
[Both:] And I'll get mine! Ay-yo!<br />
<br />
[Rap sample:] The bottom line<br />
[Double K:] Hey, man, how much money you got?<br />
[Rap sample:] Is the dollar sign!<br />
[Thes One:] Uh, check it out, yo… you get yours, yo, and I'll get…<br />
[Double K:] I'll get mine!<br />
[Thes One:] You get yours, yo, and I'll get mine, uh… look out, y'all!<br />
<br />
[Rap sample:] The bottom line<br />
[Double K:] I need a dollar, so I can get me a ciga-<br />
[Rap sample:] Is the dollar sign!<br />
[Thes One:] You spent your hard earned money… you deserve some real shit, you know what I'm sayin'? That's why this is free. Aite?<br />
[Double K:] Fun DMC!<br />
<br />
[Thes One:] P, professional rhyme from the streets<br />
U, unified, through the art we speak<br />
[Both:] T, talented hip hop freaks<br />
S, with the shit that's type: unique<br />
[Thes One:] We are the<br />

[Double K:] U<br />
[Both:] Unified, through the arts speak<br />
[Thes One:] With the T<br />
[Double K:] T<br />
[Both:] Talented hip hop freaks<br />
[Thes One:] With the S, with the shit that's type: unique<br />
[Double K:] Uh huh huh huh huh…<br />
<br />
[Thes One:] It goes<br />
[Double K:] One<br />
[Thes One:] One<br />
[Both:] Time for your mind, two times<br />
[Thes One:] For my L.A. crew<br />
[Double K:] Word.<br />
[Thes One:] Three times for the brown-skinned dimes<br />
[Both:] We go seven times for pleasure<br />
<br />
[Thes One:] Like<br />
[Both, syncopated:] One time for your mind<br />
[Thes One:] Mind, uh, mind<br />
[Both, syncopated:] Two times for my L.A. crew<br />
Three times for the brown-skinned dimes<br />
It goes seven times for pleasure<br />
<br />
[Thes One:] I said F-U-N, D-the-MC<br />
Everyone keep going, check it out, chiiiiiil</p>
