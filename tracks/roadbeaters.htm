<h1>Roadbeaters</h1>
<p><strong>Written by: Michael Turner &amp; Christopher Portugal</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>[Wannabe (Double K):] Yo, man!<br />
[Double K:] What's up?<br />
[Wannabe:] I can't wait to go on tour, man!<br />
[Double K:] Let me tell you something…<br />
[Wannabe:] Everyday, man!<br />
[Double K:] Yo, hold on…<br />
[Wannabe:] Just a gang of money…<br />
[Double K:] Nah, nah…<br />
[Wannabe:] …a gang of bitches, man…<br />
[Double K:] Ha ha, really?<br />
[Wannabe:] …groupies, limousines, man…<br />
[Double K:] It's really not like that, man.<br />
[Wannabe:] Fancy hotels, man. That shit is the bomb, yo!<br />
[Double K:] Yo… Yo, man… Yo, man, who you rolling with, man?<br />
[Wannabe:] I can't wait to go on tour, man!<br />
[Double K:] Yo, it's not like that, man.<br />
[Wannabe:] What? Uh…<br />
<br />
[Thes One:]<br />
It took years of pain, struggle, and strife from not knowing<br />
To <span class="grey-text">up-step</span> stage, sound check, and wreck shows<br />
With the nice confidence, critically precise<br />
Reassuring my brother, rolling the dice, making life ice<br />
Locked on new blocks, promoters, and cities<br />
Alone on the road, temp well-below fifty<br />
What a pity, it comes down to mics and a pillow<br />
Couple handshakes, hash browns and a hello<br />
From a fan to make it worthwhile with the plan<br />
To cover more miles than any man should have<br />
In limited time, with unlimited rhymes to give for b-boys<br />
Unified in towns where they live, worldwide<br />
And at the same time, it's still cold<br />
Thousand miles away with your life on hold<br />
At home in other times zones, doing our best<br />
Travelling train-to-plane, stretching out, getting rest<br />
In uncomfortable positions, <span class="grey-text">a show rocking missions</span><br />
Looking for an audience or crowd that'll listen<br />
And it happens, put my worthwhile in my rap<br />
And a paycheck in the form of loud handclapping<br />
Back to the hotel, next night, same thing<br />
Nothing glamorous, we're just doing our thing<br />
And go back to the hotel (same thing)<br />
Nothing glamorous, we're just doing our thing<br />
<br />
[Double K:]<br />
I come home to shadiness at least eighty percent of the time<br />
'Cause I was out getting mine, tripping, kicking the rhyme<br />
Ol' girl don't understand that's why it's getting better each time<br />
Chilling in the spotlights, Corona and lime<br />
When I point, it's the joint, y'all, I'm having a ball<br />
Travelling without the battling of who's weak and who's raw<br />
Just in the state of mind of partying and ripping rhymes<br />
Smoking out the green room, cracking jokes, drinking wine<br />
But sometimes, I unwind and find myself sober<br />
And called home in about a week, technically it's overseas<br />
Where I'mma find myself at the bottom of this<br />
Chain smoking anything, hollering at Chris<br />
He say he going through it too, asking what we gotta do<br />
I said we got an interview at a half past two<br />
With all feelings aside, a soundcheck at five o'clock<br />
We up, set to rock another night outta thirty of them<br />
Keep the greens coming (two kinds!), and I can recline<br />
Over to the next state line and dealing with time<br />
An all-star rap show, proving the thought<br />
Keeping it moving, country-to-country-to-state, we heavy grooving<br />
But you see, I got obligations at home<br />
My mind telling me someone's having relations at home<br />
All I can do is stay high and focus on the P<br />
But it's that angel and that devil, and he's sitting, fucking with me<br />
I'm L.A.-International-bound, pack up the sound, head West<br />
I got smooth intentions on breaking necks<br />
But first, I'm heading to the bank with a big grin<br />
It's a couple that know I'm coming back to do it again (ah, ha ha!)<br />
And I'm talking 'bout you, you, you… oh, but not you<br />
<br />
[Thes One:]<br />
Kiss your mama goodbye, we're hitting the road<br />
No tour bus, carrying our own load<br />
So throw it in a bag, pack it up, and let's go<br />
Travel 'round the globe, trying to rock a fresh show<br />
Kiss your mama goodbye, we're hitting the road<br />
No tour bus, carrying our own load<br />
So throw it in a bag, pack it up, and let's go<br />
Travel 'round the globe, trying to rock a fresh show<br />
<span class="grey-text">[Double's speaking behind Thes, but I can't understand him]</span><br />
<br />
[Thes One:] Yeah, hey, uh… You got any all-night foodspots, around here? You know? How about a kebab spot? Place that sells chicken? You know… Burger King open?</p>
