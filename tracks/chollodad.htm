<h1>Chollo Dad</h1> 
<p><strong>Written by: Michael Turner &amp; Christopher Portugal</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>[Thes One:] Yeah… living in L.A.… the most beautiful women on the planet… if you can get one, god dammit… watch out… messing with a Chicana, you know how it goes… you gotta watch out for pops… now, you know, let me and Double K tell you about that…<br />
[Double K:] Check it…<br />
<br />
[Thes One:]<br />
Living in L.A. is a beautiful thing<br />
On hot summer days, Cholas and <span class="grey-text">heines</span> in full swing<br />
Sidewalking with their mothers, headed back to the pad<br />
Where lurks the dangerous demon known as the Chollo dad<br />
A man with a Budweiser can<br />
And a triple-dark, faded green tat on his hand<br />
Plus his mother and his daughter's name placed on his arm for life<br />
<span class="grey-text">Vet that Donald</span> forty-years old, he packs a knife and much pride<br />
You see 'em in yards, working on rides<br />
Bumpin on <span class="grey-text">Lobo</span>, Ward, or Lakeside<br />
They take an old El Camino, make that shit look clean<br />
I'm scared of Chollo dads, let me tell you what I mean<br />
Once upon a time, I was in love with Carla<br />
High school crush, and then summertime, we start to<br />
Seeing each other, calling on the phone to talk<br />
On a hot August night, we went for a walk<br />
We made it two blocks down the street, then she kissed me<br />
Sucking on my neck, giving me a bad hickey<br />
With my hands up the shirt, putting in work mad<br />
Then she screamed and pulled away, &quot;Oh shit, it's my dad!&quot;<br />
I spun around like, &quot;Hi, sir! I'm Chris. Nice to meet ya!&quot;<br />
&quot;Are you the ese trying to fuck me Carlita? I'll kill you, vato!&quot;<br />
I screamed like a bitch, turned around and ran, seen the .22 in his hand<br />
Yo, she called the next day, like, &quot;No need to be tense<br />
But my dad's an OG who used to be from White Fence.&quot;<br />
([Mario (Double K):] That's right, homes! White Fence, ese!)<br />
White Fence? And I ain't called that girl Carla ever since!<br />
<br />
[Double K:]<br />
One day, I was chilling on Venice and Fairfax<br />
Smoking a big doobie, doing it to the max<br />
On my way to the crib, I was stunned by a pretty young face<br />
With a short frame of another race, so I stepped with the intro<br />
&quot;Baby, can I get your name and numero? I'm KK, the Superbro.&quot;<br />
She said her dad's Mario, he's not down with black guys<br />
Talking to his baby girl, he be giving black eyes<br />
I said, &quot;Yo, I understand.&quot; She said, &quot;No wait…<br />
He works the late shift, give me a call at eight.&quot;<br />
She was digging the rap, gave me a kiss on the cheek<br />
Waiting for 7:30, dude, it felt like a week<br />
8:25 hit, picked up the phone<br />
Got to dialing the digits, hoping ol' girl was home<br />
She picked up, sounded sexy, had me all aroused<br />
Said she was chilling all alone, and I could come to her house<br />
And watch a little BET, but I'm thinking cognac<br />
You know me, the Double Supreme, I'm trying to hit that<br />
So I threw on my Js, sprayed on some smell-good<br />
Threw some trees in a bag and took a stroll through my hood<br />
Close to her pad, I began wondering if<br />
Her old man'd show up and begin to rip<br />
Ay-yo, I shoulda knocked on wood, it wasn't all good<br />
Less than an hour of chilling, the door opened and there it stood<br />
([Mario (Double K):] Hey, what's up, homes?). A big, tall Mexican man<br />
With tattoos of his gang and a case in his hand<br />
God damn, yo, he had the devil in his eyes (What the fuck, homes?)<br />
And enough Brown pride to make Santana cry<br />
All I could do is ask &quot;Why me? The G, Double<br />
Gotta go through all this trouble just to-&quot;<br />
<br />
[Mario (Double K):] Hey, who the fuck are you homes?<br />
[Double K:] I'm Double K, man…<br />
[Mario:] Hey, I don't know no fucking Double K, ese!<br />
[Double K:] Hey, it's cool, how you doing, sir? I just-<br />
[Mario:] I think you're up in here trying to fuck my baby girl, homes!<br />
[Double K:] I got all my clothes on!<br />
[Mario:] Who do you think I am, homes? I'm an O.G., ese!<br />
[Double K:] Yeah, you're a dad, man. I'm, I'm not-<br />
[Mario:] C'mere, homes. Let me talk to you…<br />
[Double K:] Yo, it's… chill, chill out.<br />
[Mario:] C'mere, ese!<br />
[Double K:] Nah, man. It's cool man. I'm not-I'm n- I'm n-<br />
[Mario:] I'm gonna fuck you up righteous, homes!<br />
[Double K:] I ain't trying to fight you, O.G. It's cool, man…<br />
[Mario:] You're nothing!<br />
[Double K:] Hey, I know, man. It's-<br />
[Mario:] You're not good enough for my baby girl, homes!<br />
[Double K:] Ay-yo, yo, just-<br />
[Mario:] She's gonna be down with Pee-Wee for the rest of her life!<br />
[Double K:] Ay-yo, man, fuck Pee-Wee, I'm about to leave you-<br />
[Mario:] Ay, fuck you!<br />
[Double K:] I'm outta here!</p>
