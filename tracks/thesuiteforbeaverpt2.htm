<h1>The Suite For Beaver, Pt. 2</h1> 
<p><strong>Written by: Michael Turner &amp; Christopher Portugal</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>[Thes One:] We're not gonna play any hip-hop tonight.<br />
[Double K:] Aw, shit. Yeah, that's right.<br />
[Thes One:] Ha, that sounds nice.<br />
[Double K:] That's right. What's going down? Yeah, alright. Okay.<br />
[Announcer:] See, I think I'll just…<br />
[Double K:] Go to the studio today… What? Yeah. Ho! What's going down, bro? Yeah, I can feel ya. Yeah, man, you promoting still? Alright. It's okay.<br />
[Thes One:] We partying… we partying…<br />
[Double K:] Yo… yo… what's up with you, <span class="grey-text">fool</span>? Haaaaa. This fool Thes One. Ay-yo, what's up, Thes?<br />
<br/>
[Thes One:]<br />
I walk in, talking to friendly faces in my aces<br />
Drinking beer, smoking beedis in the back where the bass is<br />
The place is packed, doubly stacked with ladies of nice asses<br />
The only ice rocked is in glasses (alright)<br />
I move on, the DJ rocks a new song<br />
People flooding the dance floor, just to get their groove on<br />
To that old funky and tough, the speaker bump buff<br />
JB horns blowing, they throw in some black stuff<br />
And the crowd goes nuts like a disco dream<br />
Seat reserved for Thes, candlelit, table is clean<br />
The brown wicker chair, looking like Al Green<br />
Sitting back, legs crossed, straight checking out the scene<br />
([Double K:] Oh no!)<br />
Crowd looking and slinging to Eddie Bo<br />
While I'm walking to the bar 'cause my drink's getting low<br />
I need a Long Island Iced Tea, double, no ice<br />
Something fruity for these two cuties 'cause they look nice<br />
They giggle and they whisper, her friend called me Mister<br />
Thes One of the P, she's getting geeked, so I kissed her on the cheek<br />
Double stepped in ([Double K:] Yeah, what's up, y'all?)<br />
I see these pretty dudes eyeballing from the wall and I stepped back<br />
([Double K:] Man.) This is a family party! We don't act ill<br />
So I'mma tell these young punks that they gots to chill<br />
<br />
[Double K:]<br />
Woah, they say the bigger the headache, the bigger the pill<br />
People Under The Staircase dropped, ya feel?<br />
I'm smelling like dope and I'm shooting for more<br />
Eyes glued to the <span class="grey-text">nookie</span> moving slow on the floor<br />
I say she hella sexy and her friends were markable<br />
Conversation was rolled up… yeah, sparkable<br />
But wait, here come my nigga from the big bad Heights<br />
Said he had to stash the yee so it won't be no fights<br />
See, real niggas do it right 'cause we partying, y'all<br />
Don't need no flowers on the wall, I need a glass that's tall<br />
Full of the &quot;Strong&quot; Island to get the KK wiling<br />
I spot Thes One with some freaks and they smiling<br />
I slide to the bar, being the coolest, ya dig?<br />
Tell my man, &quot;The usual, plus a shot for the kid&quot;<br />
He did his bartender thizzle, got my order in a jif<br />
He spotted suckas looking cool like they wanna get with me<br />
But, man…<br />
<br />
[Thes One:] <span class="grey-text">??</span> these guys, man<br />
[Double K:] I <span class="grey-text">ain't dosed with</span> these dudes, you know what I'm saying?<br />
[Thes One:] They don't understand…<br />
[Double K:] They don't even know… you know?<br />
[Thes One:] But… check it out, ladies<br />
[Double K:] All the girls… tuh…<br />
[Thes One:] Uh huh…<br />
[Double K:] So they can see where we…<br />
[Thes One:] Alright, dog…<br />
<br />
[Double K:]<br />
Yo… see, this is my house, and I know everybody here<br />
We all bubbly like the beginning of the year on the eve<br />
Turn that shit off, I ride rougher than that, my pride's tougher than that<br />
My niggas kicking raps in the corner, I jump in, like<br />
&quot;Hop hop hippy&quot; to the &quot;you don't quit&quot;, Double Mike is legit<br />
I get pounds from my friends, I do the Flavor Flav and I jet<br />
Then get my whistle wet, but, oops, I couldn't forget<br />
Yo, remember that light-skinned, big Freak of the Week<br />
Walked up, feeling like one of the members of Chic<br />
I said, &quot;Baby, I'm full of 'Good Times', let me touch your '(Funny) Bone'<br />
Is it cool if we go home together?&quot;… &quot;Whatever,&quot; she smiled<br />
Yo, I could tell she was playful like a child<br />
I grabbed her hand, said &quot;C'mon, it's time to party down!&quot;<br />
You know?<br />
<br />
[Double K:] I know you wanna party down right?<br />
[Roscoe:] Hey! What's up, Mike?<br />
[Double K:] Hey, is that your friend over there? You tell her to come on over here and get with the program, okay?<br />
[Roscoe:] Hey, Mike. Man, I'm glad you came through, man. Did you have a ball or what, man?<br />
[Double K:] I know, here's my boy Thes One. Don't be afraid, he don't bite. Yeah, he fresh, know what I'm saying?<br />
[Roscoe:] Aw, naw. Now, I see you with the lady and all, man, but check me out, man, I got to talk to you for a minute, man, yo, I'm glad you came through.<br />
[Double K:] Yeah, now, he don't bite either…<br />
[Roscoe:] Now, ya- now, look, lady, I ain't gonna bite ya, it- Yo, check it out. Big Mike, what's going down?<br />
[Double K:] Yeah… that's right… well, can- can ya dig it?<br />
[Roscoe:] She can dig it, man. Just cool out.<br />
[Double K:] Let's go outside for a minute, have a smoke with me.<br />
[Roscoe:] Hey, Mike, where ya going, man? Fuck it, I'mma party then, yo! Shit!<br />
[Double K:] Alright, Thes One, you be cool.<br />
[Roscoe:] Look, ma- yo, what's up, Chris? Yo, com- aw, shit…<br />
[Double K:] Yeah, yeah…<br />
[Roscoe:] I'mma go get me a lady, man… yeah, party, party… hey, this was a real cool party, y'all… made a whole lot of money at the bar… yeah… these tables is fucked up! Oh…</p>
