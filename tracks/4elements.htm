<h1>4 Elements</h1>
<p><strong>Written by: Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Michael Turner &amp; Christopher Portugal</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>[Thes One, with echo effect:]<br />
Aight, man… Part two! Wordsworth, Coleridge… and the beeeees! Yeah, this is where it gets funky, y'all!<br />
<br />
And through the drifts the snowy cliffs<br />
Did send a dismal sheen:<br />
Nae shapes of men, nae beasts we ken – <br />
The ice was all between.<br />
<br />
The ice was here, the ice was there,<br />
The ice was all around:<br />
It cracked and growled, and roared and howled,<br />
Like noises of a swound!<br />
<br />
And thro' the drifts the snowy clifts<br />
Did send a dismal sheen;<br />
Ne shapes of men ne beasts we ken--<br />
The Ice was all between.<br />
<br />
The Ice was here, the Ice was there,<br />
The Ice was all around:<br />
It crack'd and growl'd, and roar'd and howl'd--<br />
Like noises of a swound.<br />
<br />
At length did cross an Albatross,<br />
Thorough the Fog it came;<br />
And an it were a Christian Soul,<br />
We hail'd it in God's name.<br />
<br />
The Marineres gave it biscuit-worms,<br />
And round and round it flew:<br />
The Ice did split with a thunder-fit;<br />
The Helmsman steer'd us thro'. KA-BOOM!<br />
<br />
And good south wind up behind;<br />
The Albatross did follow,<br />
And every day, for food or play,<br />
Came to the Marinere's hello!<br />
<br />
Hello, birds! C'mere! Yeaaaah!<br />
<br />
In mist or cloud, on mast or shroud,<br />
It perched for vespers nine;<br />
Whiles all the night, through fog-smoke white,<br />
Glimmered the white moonshine.&quot;<br />
<br />
'God save thee, ancyent Marinere!<br />
From the fields that plague thee thus! – <br />
Why look'st thou so?' -&quot;With my crossbow<br />
I shot the Albatross.&quot;<br />
<br />
I shot it, ahhhh… yeah, I shot it…<br />
<br />
&quot;The sun came up upon the right:<br />
Out of the sea came he,<br />
And rod, as a weft upon the left<br />
Went down into the sea.<br />
<br />
Good south wind still blew behind,<br />
But no sweet bird did follow,<br />
Ne any day for food or play<br />
Came to the mariners' hello!<br />
<br />
Hello, bird! But it was gone… oh yeah!<br />
It was dead… I think you… I think you feel me now…<br />
<br />
And I had done a hellish thing,<br />
And it would work 'em woe:<br />
For all averred, I'd killed the bird<br />
That made the breeze to blow.<br />
<br />
Fried chicken…<br />
<br />
Ne dim ne red, like God's own head,<br />
The glorious sun uprist:<br />
Then all averred, I had killed the bird<br />
That brought the fog and mist.<br />
<br />
'Twas right, said they, such birds to slay,<br />
That bring the fog and mist.<br />
'Twas right, said they, such birds to slay,<br />
They bring that fog and mist.<br />
<br />
The breezes blew, the white foam flew,<br />
The furrow followed free;<br />
We were the first that ever burst<br />
Into that silent sea.<br />
<br />
Down dropped the breeze, the sails dropped down,<br />
'Twas sad as sad could be;<br />
And we did speak only to break<br />
The silence of the sea!<br />
<br />
It was quiet…<br />
<br />
All in a hot and copper sky,<br />
The bloody sun, at noon,<br />
Right above the mast did stand,<br />
No bigger than the moon.<br />
<br />
Things are getting worse…<br />
Part-eth the third… Wordsworth and Colridge…<br />
<br />
Day after day, day after day,<br />
We stuck, ne breath ne motion;<br />
As idle as a painted ship<br />
Upon a painted ocean.<br />
<br />
Water, water, every where,<br />
And all the boards did shrink;<br />
Water, water, every where,<br />
Ne any drop to drink.<br />
<br />
The very deep did rot: O Christ!<br />
That ever should be!<br />
Yea, slimy things did crawl with legs<br />
Upon the slimy sea.<br />
<br />
About, about, in reel and rout<br />
The death-fires danced at night;<br />
<br />
That's them dancing…<br />
<br />
The water, like a witch's oils,<br />
Burnt green, blue, and white.<br />
<br />
And some in dreams assured were<br />
Of the Spirit that plagued us so;<br />
Nine fathom deep he had followed us<br />
From the land of mist and snow.<br />
<br />
And every tongue, thorough utter drouth,<br />
Was withered at the root;<br />
We could not speak, no more than if<br />
We had been choked with soot.<br />
<br />
Uh… uh huh… uh huh…<br />
<br />
Ah! wel-a-day! what evil looks<br />
Had I from old and young!<br />
Instead of the cross, the Albatross<br />
About my neck was hung.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tough break…<br />
<br />
I saw something in the sky<br />
No bigger than my fist<br />
At first it seemed a little speck,<br />
And then it seemed a mist;<br />
It moved and moved, and took at last<br />
A certain shape, I wist.<br />
<br />
A speck, a mist, a shape, I wist!<br />
And still it neared and neared:<br />
And an' it dodged a water-sprite,<br />
It plunged and tacked and veered.<br />
<br />
With throat unslaked, with lips black,<br />
Nae could we laugh nae wail;<br />
Then while the draft, all dumb they stood!<br />
I bit my arm, and sucked the blood,<br />
And cried, A sail! a sail!<br />
<br />
With throats unslaked, with black lips baked,<br />
Agape they heard the call:<br />
Gramercy! They for joy did grin,<br />
And all at once their breath drew in, HUH!<br />
As they were drinking all.<br />
<br />
She doffed my tack from side to side<br />
Hither to work us weal;<br />
Without the wind, without a tide,<br />
She steadies with upright keel!<br />
<br />
That's the sound of her steady<br />
Bring it 'round!<br />
<br />
The western wave was all a-flame,<br />
The day was well nigh done!<br />
Almost upon the western wave<br />
Rested the broad bright sun;<br />
When that strange shape drove suddenly<br />
Betwixt us and the sun.<br />
<br />
And straight the sun was flecked with bars,<br />
(Heaven's Mother send us grace!)<br />
And if through a dungeon-grate he peered<br />
With broad and burning face. Ssss!<br />
<br />
Alas! (thought I, and my heart beat loud)<br />
How fast she nears and nears!<br />
Are those her sails that glance in the sun,<br />
Like restless gossameres?<br />
<br />
Are those her naked ribs which 'flect the sun<br />
That behind them peer?<br />
And are those two all- all the crew?<br />
That women and her freshless fear?<br />
<br />
Yo…<br />
<br />
His bones were black with many a crack<br />
All black and bare, I ween;<br />
Jet-black and bare, save where the rust<br />
Of mouldy damps and charnel crust<br />
They're patch'd with purple and green.<br />
<br />
Yeah…<br />
<br />
Her lips were red, her looks were free,<br />
Her locks were yellow as gold:<br />
Her skin was as white as leprosy,<br />
And she is far liker Death than he : <br />
The flesh makes the still air cold.<br />
<br />
What a bitch… ouch…<br />
<br />
The naked hulk alongside came,<br />
And the twain were playing dice;<br />
'The game is done! I've won! I've won!'<br />
Quoth she, and whistled thrice.<br />
<br />
Brrrr… brrr… brrr… I don't know how to whistle…<br />
<br />
A gust of wind starts up behind<br />
And whistled thro' his bones:<br />
Thro' the holes of his eyes and the hole of his mouth<br />
Half-whistles and half-groans.<br />
<br />
Mmmm… ahhh… sh… on the sea…<br />
<br />
With never a whisper in the Sea<br />
Off darts the Spectre-ship;<br />
While clombe above the Eastern bar<br />
The horned Moon, with one bright Star<br />
Almost atween the tips.<br />
<br />
One after one by the horned moon<br />
(Listen, O Strangerl to me).<br />
Each turned his face with a ghastly pang,<br />
And cursed me with his eye.<br />
<br />
Four times fifty living men,<br />
With never a sigh or groan<br />
With heavy thump, a lifeless lump,<br />
They dropped down one by one.<br />
<br />
BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!<br />
<br />
The souls did from their bodies fly, - <br />
They fled to bliss or woe!<br />
And every soul it passed me by,<br />
Like the whizz of my crossbow!&quot;<br />
<br />
Damn, uh… Ouch…</p>
