<h1>E Business (feat. JazMak)</h1>
<p><strong>Written by: Michael Turner, Christopher Portugal &amp; Andre Satchel</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>[JazMak:] Yo, huh?… I just want to know if, uh… You ever had a dream, you were pissing? Woke up, and uh… you were pissing? Yeah? Get a brand new bag of our own… We're… Undisputed Champs… I'm JazMak… watch:<br />
<br />
[JazMak:]<br />
JazMak, the L.A. hip-hop Phantom Menace<br />
Rip your crew to finish, the records I blemished<br />
The one and only young brother with nothing to prove<br />
Except for myself, that's why I'm making some moves<br />
Don't be a fool, little dude, rap is worth its while<br />
Keep your lyrics tight and make you listen and smile<br />
But the real test: to keep the crowd impressed<br />
We got the Lyrics To Go, like A Tribe Called Quest<br />
And keep your mind on the up-and-up, you'll go real far<br />
Don't worry about my crew, we know exactly who we are<br />
We are the Undisputed Champs, so fuck what your squad say<br />
Kicking dope shit for your moms and your padre<br />
Whether Jaz or Andre, you'll remember the name<br />
My words will live forever 'cause you know I got fame<br />
Pussy-ass wack niggas going out like Blaine<br />
One trip through the Heights, you would never be the same<br />
And in this game, we're not uplifting the kid<br />
Just out lifting the fizz, and then we handle our biz<br />
Until the next time, I'mma let you speak<br />
Fuck where you come from, that's where I take my leaks!<br />
[All:] Fuck where you come from, that's where I take my leaks! (x4)<br />
<br />
[Thes One:]<br />
I smash in the media marker, crash in the darker<br />
Bring forth the lighter, light up the beedi, inhale<br />
Stale writers prevail in 1999<br />
So I collaborate with the greatest of all times<br />
Write on rhymes, true to what I know, I stick to<br />
Who said it was all glitz, I exhale, this shit is stale<br />
Old beedis are like new hip-hop, so when I stop to think<br />
I cop a drink, and then drop myself on the porch<br />
Picked up the torch, young Olympic runner under fire<br />
Like a tail-gun, enough heat to compete with summer<br />
So don't sweat it, crews dread it like ([Double K:] Yea, mon)<br />
And jerk chickens sicken when they see us start sprinting<br />
Recalling monotheist ideas, wishing God would save 'em<br />
Heal the wounds <span class="grey-text">they</span> gave 'em, finish 'em off soft, bless<br />
Then raise 'em to heaven, but they left eleven like<br />
&quot;Man, I should have seen it coming.&quot;<br />
My battle uniform decorated like the <span class="grey-text">drum and</span> residents<br />
Evidently <span class="grey-text">'nuff</span> pressure, check my tracks on record<br />
And when it's crunch time, C Portugal's rap beneath the line<br />
Making heads rewind the shit to show L.A. how I did it<br />
Like MBNA, give credit when I come wit' it<br />
I applicate, raise your interest rate, way past great<br />
I late-night mix tapes and shows, got beats and flows<br />
Just good old L.A. music for bros and hos<br />
[All:] Just good old L.A. music for bros and hos (x4)<br />
<br />
[Double K:] (Yo… word, check it… it's like that, the P, uh… yo, what happened to the good old days?… 1992…)<br />
Yo, I sway back and forth like a reggae song<br />
<span class="grey-text">Chop breeze</span> division I see through like dunce crews<br />
When you walking, talking scary, get the fuck out of Dodge<br />
I'm on a mission that I complete, <span class="grey-text">it won't</span> be for a minute<br />
And your party ain't starting until the P run up in it<br />
With a case and a crate of some of that Old School<br />
To get the OG's on the wall get up and act the fool<br />
I'm the rapper, dapping, snapping at the fucking moment<br />
And everybody disagreeing? It's duck season!<br />
Tuck your chest in and be safe, otherwise I erase your whole existence<br />
From this hip-hop business, yo, I'm only in this<br />
To start shit and drink beer, catch some ducats in my pocket<br />
Grab the microphone and rock it like Herbie in 'Eight-Tray, <span class="grey-text">or NASA</span><br />
The word <span class="grey-text">wizard</span> always kicking straight out of L.A.<br />
Two twenty-four to be exact… ([Scratched sample:] Where that at?)<br />
The Westside of where you at, we lay low in the back<br />
Like your family dog ([Spoken sample:] How's that?)<br />
We just kicking it, laughing at you sucka niggas sounding ridiculous<br />
JazMak, Thes One, and the K got your attention, cooking up exotic shit<br />
Nigga, stay up out the… … and you know…<br />
<br />
[Spoken sample:] Now, continue leaning forward until the top of the head is resting on the floor. This is done by raising the back. Let the hands rest where they were… inhale and exhale slowly, and hold it as long as it is comfortable…<br />
<br />
Inhale… exhale… (x4)</p>
