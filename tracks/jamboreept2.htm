<h1>Jamboree, Pt. 2</h1>
<p><strong>Written by: Michael Turner &amp; Christopher Portugal</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>[Double K:] Get my barbeque… yo, do it like this… all the barbeque's in <span class="grey-text">the back</span>… let's just chill… pour up s'more of these drinks… put your cell phones down… just get up, you know what I mean? Get up… You get up… Get up!<br />
[Thes One:] Hey, Beto, come here, and, um… go down… go down, and have 'em get, uh… yeah, five dollars… y'all put in two… and uh, we need s'more beer, man… c'mon…<br />
<br />
[Double K:]<br />
The barbeque is done, and I'm not sober<br />
Looking for some skins, so I can (Shut yo' mouth!)<br />
Alright, I mean come over and rub my back<br />
They can drink on this Bombay and smoke this sack<br />
But I don't have any phone numbers at hand<br />
And all the girls around here cooling with their man<br />
Plan B: pour up another cup and erupt<br />
Ay-yo, Thes come get this drink!<br />
([Thes One:] Yo, man, I can't, I'm cleaning up, man!)<br />
Man, I'm cleanin' up!? Yo, later for that!<br />
It's only midnight, and this is where it's at<br />
Threw on some Parliament to re-ignite the night<br />
A couple more people arrive with Amstel Light<br />
&quot;Ay-yo, who the fuck are they?&quot; I said with a slur<br />
They stepped into the light, and all I seen was her<br />
You better watch that man, yo, I'mma punch her man<br />
And dance around the room, so I can kiss her hand<br />
But that approach wouldn't be civilized right?<br />
So I sang Flashlight, the 12-inch version<br />
It seems like my liver is the only thing I'm hurting<br />
Blurting out obscenities seem to be the remedy<br />
([Thes One:] Hey, man, c'mon!)<br />
I'm sure these people around, they want to get rid of me, man<br />
But, yo, just keep partying, man… I know…<br />
What's up? C'mon, let's dance, man, aw, my bad…<br />
My… let's dance, yo…<br />
<br />
([Double K:] Yo, what's wrong, man? What'd I say, man?<br />
[Thes One:] Aight, it's cool, man!<br />
[Double K:] Yo, let's <span class="grey-text">do the home</span><br />
[Thes One:] It's cool, man, don't worry about it…<br />
[Double K:] Let's <span class="grey-text">do the home</span>, you know…<br />
<br />
[Thes One:]<br />
Dude, this house is a mess ([Double K:] No, it ain't, man!)<br />
Most everybody left<br />
Some didn't say &quot;bye,&quot; it's cool, only the crew's here<br />
Time to post up, there's a couple of beers<br />
&quot;Hey, y'all, cheers to a good night,&quot; another J they light<br />
They'll probably stay all night, I'd rather that than they leave<br />
If they stumble to the door, I'm surely takin' their keys<br />
I grab a seat, we reminisce about old times like Aladdin's Castle<br />
DJ Aladdin, 2 Live Crew rhymes, and 2-player Madden<br />
I guess it's kind of sad when it's the end of the night<br />
The homie Beto came back with some Amstel Light<br />
And Mikey's beatboxing basslines to Flashlight<br />
They argue and laugh, it's all funny to me<br />
I got all my homies drunk on my balcony<br />
I can feel myself fading as a story's relayed about a DJ that played<br />
&quot;Masquarade&quot; by Ace and Ab Rude, I wake up, like<br />
&quot;Dude, L.A.'s the shit!&quot;, they all nod their head,  take another hit<br />
&quot;You might remember that H-block shit&quot;… ([Double K:] Yeah, man!)<br />
I feel myself fading, another hit….<br />
([Double K:] Yo… fucking went to sleep… Get yo' ass up!<br />
[Thes One:] Yo… you know, man… I wanna get up, man… I wanna make a margarita… You wanna marga- You w- Ay-yo… Ay, I gotta margarita, man…<br />
[Guy #1:] What you doing?<br />
[Thes One:] Aight, <span class="grey-text">man, sit</span>… I'm making a margarita, man! Chill out, yo! Man, I'm cool…<br />
[Double K:] Man, just let him make his margarita, man!<br />
[Thes One:] You gonna drink this, it's good, man… aight, you gonna have some of this, or I'm not gonna drink it… <br />
[Double K:] Ahh, this margarita is good…<br />
[Thes One:] Naw, man! I'm not gonna…<br />
[Double K:] What's wrong with you, man? Yo, get together, man. Why you bugging out, man? What's up?<br />
[Thes One:] You know… I gotta clean this shit up now, man. I don't even know… Man, I don't know <span class="grey-text">who barfed the fuck all over</span><br />
[Double K:] Clean this shit up, man… I'll help you…</p>
