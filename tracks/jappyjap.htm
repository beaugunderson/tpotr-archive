<h1>Jappy Jap</h1> 
<p><strong>Written by: Michael Turner &amp; Christopher Portugal</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>[Double K:] Let's hit 'em with it… About to get <span class="grey-text">boots</span>, iller on these dudes… Sugar Ray 'em… and I mean Leonard… check it out… yo…<br />
<br />
[Rap sample with Double K:] A brother who's known for his rap!<br />
[Thes One:] Ha!<br />
[Rap sample:] Double K<br />
[Double K:] Yeah, the Double K, you know<br />
[Rap sample with Double K:] The brother who's known for his rap<br />
[Double K:] And who's that?<br />
[Rap sample:] Thes One!<br />
[Double K:] And that's my man, Thes One<br />
[Rap sample with Double K:] The brother who's known for his rap<br />
[Double K:] Yup, they call me Double K, and yo<br />
[Rap sample with Double K:] A brother who's known for his rap<br />
[Thes One:] Way to go! Way to go!<br />
[Double K:] Ha… my man, Jappy Jap!<br />
<br />[Double K:]<br />
Now if you see me in a lab coat, don't think I'm just chlling<br />
I'm rubbing my palms together, got plans on taking the villain<br />
Like my nigga Ren, if it ain't rough, it ain't me<br />
And if the beat ain't knocking you over, you know it ain't the P<br />
Guaranteed to be in stock like these busters getting blocked<br />
That's niggas getting mopped from these floors that we rock<br />
They missing hip hop, you see hip hop be missing me with that bull<br />
I got <span class="grey-text">pulled</span> quick, come loaded with the full clip<br />
Blast up your party like a shoot-em-up flick<br />
Busting through the swinging doors with aggression galore<br />
You learnt your lesson before, I hope they keep you on tour<br />
Take your money followed by a pimp slap, that ain't rap<br />
More like a ribbing, man, it's only given that I hit men<br />
All in they emotion glands, I claim <span class="grey-text">band</span> and those niggers know it<br />
They sure ain't coming around, acting fly<br />
Drinking forties, always telling lies in they rhymes<br />
I think they're trying too much, I keep 'em crying too much<br />
The Double keep 'em in a clutch, and with self I stay in touch<br />
But here's a letter for the weak who speak trash when they talk<br />
Take a walk before you end up on stage in chalk, 'cause I'm<br />
<br />
[Rap sample with Double K:] A brother who's known for his rap!<br />
[Thes One:] Yeah, the most supreme, the Double K<br />
[Rap sample with Double K:] The brother who's known for his rap!<br />
[Double K:] And who's who?<br />
[Thes One:] Thes One, drinking beer, having fun in the back<br />
[Rap sample with Double K:] A brother who's known for his rap!<br />
[Thes One:] Jappy Jap<br />
[Double K:] The self contained Double K…and who?<br />
[Rap sample with Double K:] A brother who's known for his rap!<br />
[Both:] Jappy Jap!<br />
[Richard Pryor sample:] Aw, yeah…<br />
<br />
[Thes One:]<br />
It's my job, I twist knobs and make the <span class="grey-text">odds</span> seem to operate chemical<br />
Lyrically polemical, touch <span class="grey-text">ya</span> like a tide pool tentacle<br />
Identical, to unendable, unbendable metal<br />
You claim ghetto fame, that same game, another buster<br />
Crashing through your tracks, I'm the wax claim adjuster<br />
Kick, kick, snare, high-hat, vinyl cognac<br />
Shining like a Sly Stone belt on felt slip mats<br />
You kit-kat, breaking with the new data Zip DAT<br />
<span class="grey-text">Hate</span> to megabyte my hipstyle like a reptile<br />
I'm Croc Hunter, dumb done, we're block blunters<br />
<span class="grey-text">Bleeding</span> beedi burners <span class="grey-text">to</span> Portugals and Turners<br />
Who freaking what we speaking like a deacon who's tweaking<br />
Or a heat-seeking missile ([Double K:] And all you hearing is the whistle)<br />
And jump out your Fubu while we thizzle you<br />
Fizzle <span class="grey-text">is a locate</span> set to take down, translate sound<br />
Tape-deck bound, non-stop to tour jet<br />
Gonna touch your town, if we haven't already yet ([Double K:] Uh huh)<br />
I met a lot of people (Uh huh)<br />
They're waiting for the sequel (Uh huh)<br />
Well here it is, O-S-Teach kids about the People<br />
<br />
[Richard Pryor sample:] Aw, yeah… (repeated and scratched)<br />
[Double K:] Yo, and that's how we bringing it like that<br />
Never came square, never thought about coming square<br />
It's the <span class="grey-text">mother</span> with the P, it's me<br />
And my man Thes One, and he rock like that<br />
They call me the Double K, and yo, I rock like that<br />
Brothers known for the rap, we keep it like that<br />
It's the P brother who gets weak like that<br />
[Rap sample:] A brother who's known for his rap (scratched)<br />
[Double K:] Yo… for his rap, you know where we at<br />
L.A.… Los Angeles… Straight up<br />
It's a sunny sky and everything's looking good<br />
Hey, Thes One, how we feel?<br />
<br />
You know… Peace!</p>
