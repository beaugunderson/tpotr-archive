<h1>Talkin' Back To The Streets</h1>
<p><strong>Written by: Michael Turner &amp; Christopher Portugal</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>[Thes One:] We waited <span class="grey-text">mad</span>, man!<br />
[Double K:] Word, word…<br />
[Man #1:] Fuck!<br />
[Double K:] Long flight, man, long flight…<br />
[Thes One:] Who's picking you up, man?<br />
[Double K:] Ah, you know, I think I'mma take a cab, man…<br />
[Thes One:] Word?<br />
[Double K:] …check out the city, yeah, <span class="grey-text">check out the facilities if you know what I mean…</span><br />
[Thes One:] Yeah, yeah, that sounds alright, man… take a shower, get some food… been long time, man, rocking all these shows, you know… and going back to the streets…<br />
[Double K:] Back to the streets forever, man…<br />
([Airplane voiceover:] <span class="grey-text">?</span>... please turn off all electronic devices, the flight attendants will be coming through the aisles shortly for all plates, cans, trash, <span class="grey-text">?</span>…)<br />
<br />
[Thes One:]<br />
Her familiar smell over the breeze, my knees pop<br />
Palm trees, silhouette mountains and rooftops<br />
Her freeway arteries consistently stay clogged<br />
She coughs smog, she raised me, she hugs me, says &quot;good job&quot;<br />
So where we going first?<br />
Eating Thirst Quenchers, then I guess a little rest<br />
Or better yet, etiquette say I better get ready for my first night<br />
Home in the twilight, home in a long time<br />
Finally, feeling that feels right<br />
I see the streets and eat a piece of something from the past<br />
Highlight memories, we growing up so fast<br />
But I guess that's the best lesson the streets teach<br />
The six million stories, not a single one repeats<br />
So I kept the beach close by my side, learned pride in the cul-de-sac<br />
And now I'm returning to give back my lessons if I can<br />
Kiss her hand one more time<br />
'Cause she kept me laced up and never slipping on the grind<br />
I'm goin…<br />
<br />
[Sung sample:] Back to the street, that's where I belong…<br />
[Spoken sample, scratched:] It's been a long time…<br />
[Sung sample:] I'm going back to the street, that's where I belong…<br />
[Spoken sample, scratched:] It's been a long time…<br />
[Sung sample:] I'm going back to the street, that's where I belong…<br />
[Spoken sample, scratched:] It's been a long time…<br />
[Sung sample:] I'm going back to the street, that's where I belong…<br />
[Spoken sample, scratched:] It's been a long time…<br />
[Sung sample:] I'm goin…<br />
<br />
[Rap sample:] Came home and I can safely say<br />
That L.A. is a much better place to stay<br />
<br />
[Double K:]<br />
See, I been gone for quite some time<br />
Was dealing with the struggle, so I left it behind<br />
Saw a star in the sky with one eye as the beholder<br />
Tried to wear that jacket, but it seems to get colder<br />
The older I get, the more that it's clear<br />
The more that I see, the more that I fear<br />
But where I come from, you see it simple and plain<br />
Phonograph stereo up on your window pane<br />
Shootin' the breeze with your neighbors and your friends<br />
Staying in touch, that's where it all begins<br />
Lose sight and you're blind to the noise and the sound<br />
Need to reach back, brother, put your feet on the ground<br />
I done seen and done it all, good and bad<br />
Experienced every emotion, and no longer mad<br />
The only thing I regret is not knowing<br />
So I'm packing my bags (I'm out) and I'm going<br />
<br />
[Sung sample:] Back to the street, that's where I belong…<br />
[Spoken sample, scratched:] It's been a long time…<br />
[Sung sample:] I'm going back to the street, that's where I belong…<br />
[Spoken sample, scratched:] It's been a long time…<br />
[Sung sample:] I'm going back to the street, that's where I belong…<br />
[Spoken sample, scratched:] It's been a long time…<br />
[Sung sample:] I'm goin…<br />
<br />
[Rap sample:] L.A. is a much better place…<br />
[Sung sample:] City I live in…<br />
The city of Angels… (repeated and scratched)<br />
<br />
[Spoken sample:] All we got is the streets! That's it…<br />
<br />
[Thes One:] Aw shit, who is this? Hello?<br />
[Double K:] Yeah, what's happnin', buddy? Man, it's Big Mike, man, the one you like. What's goin' down?<br />
[Thes One:] Man, nothing, man. I was just about to put my PJs…<br />
[Double K:] Anyway, I… look man, I'm going out to party tonight, but I just wanted to invite you and your lady out...</p>
