<h1>All Good Things</h1>
<p><strong>Written by: Michael Turner &amp; Christopher Portugal</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>[Thes One:]<br />
What am I still doing here?<br />
Alone backstage with the last of the free beer<br />
At home, I'm just a photo on the wall, life goes on<br />
Most times, they don't even call, I stay gone<br />
They said, &quot;We won't buy your music, you'll get paid at the show&quot;<br />
The shitty motel, twenty miles down the road, is so cheap<br />
There's no sleep, bugs in the sheets<br />
There's no soap, there's no hope, music is free<br />
We're waking up with the club smell, the sweat-soaked fitted hat<br />
Yo, why the hell would I even Twitter that?<br />
Direct contact with the invisible man<br />
The same Stan at the merch table, shaking my hands<br />
The young man uploaded my soul on a P2P or Sharebee<br />
I get so exhausted, my thoughts start to scare me<br />
The one-lane highway on the road to the unknown<br />
All I've got is this left, I can't go home<br />
<br />
[Double K:]<br />
If you can't make it, then we won't make it<br />
If you can't give it up, then you can't take it<br />
And what's done is done and won't ever come again<br />
Because all good things must come to an end<br />
If we can't make it, then we won't make it<br />
If you can't give it up, then you can't take it<br />
And what's done is done and won't ever come again<br />
Because all good things must come to an end<br />
<br />
[Thes One:]<br />
What's become bedroom, auto-tuned Pro Tools on flat screens<br />
With George Clinton redfining what &quot;black&quot; means<br />
Landing Motherships in downtown coliseums<br />
James Brown, the whole world paid to see him<br />
But things are so damn safe, there's no more risk<br />
The ten-second download, listen, erase it from your harddisk<br />
Disposable artists on Facebook with the good look<br />
<span class="grey-text">Except the heroes squashed, branded with AdHook</span><br />
Everyone's mad shook-up, a bad look<br />
We missed the sunset, we were glued to a MacBook<br />
And so much music, now, and so much gets discarded<br />
I ain't heard a classic record since this whole downloading shit started<br />
Progress with no direction, fans curate the art collection<br />
&quot;Sorry, this section's closed.&quot;<br />
Show's over, not enough tickets sold, I suppose<br />
It's not worth it now, sign in the windows goes:<br />
<br />
[Double K:]<br />
If we can't make it, then we won't make it<br />
If you can't give it up, then you can't take it<br />
And what's done is done and won't ever come again<br />
Because all good things must come to an end<br />
If we can't make it, then we won't make it<br />
If you can't give it up, then you can't take it<br />
And what's done is done and won't ever come again<br />
Because all good things must come to an end<br />
<br />
[Thes One:]<br />
To the man, James Brown (rock, rock on)<br />
To the group, Led Zeppelin (you rock, rock on)<br />
To the legend, Michael Jackson (you rock, rock on)<br />
To the man, Miles Davis (you rock, rock on)<br />
To the Stereolab (we gave you rock, rock on)<br />
To the Radiohead (you know you gotta rock on)<br />
To the Biz Markie (you forever rock on)<br />
To the DJ Premier (yo, you keep rocking on)<br />
And to the Beastie Boys (you always come correct)<br />
To the music man, Beck (gotta keep 'em in check)<br />
To the US Funk Mob (stay doing the job)<br />
To my man, Double K (you know, you rock, rock on)<br />
To my man, Double K (yo, my brother, rock on)<br />
Uh, to my man, Double K (L.A., rock on)<br />
People Under the Stairs (you know, we gotta stay strong)<br />
<br />
[Sung sample:]<br />
I hope they shine forever, as long as we're together<br />
I hope they shine forever, as long as we're together<br />
I hope they shine forever, as long as we're together</p>
