<h1>Mid-City Fiesta</h1>
<p><strong>Written by: Michael Turner &amp; Christopher Portugal</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>[Spoken sample:] &quot;What does THAT mean?&quot;<br />
&quot;You got me… we'll just have to wait and see…&quot;<br />
&quot;Climbing the ladder to the empty guest house, the three friends settle down for a much-needed night's sleep…&quot;<br />
<br />
[Double K:] I was chilling at the crib, about 12 o' clock<br />
When Thes Love called up, he knew a party we could rock<br />
Sometime around eight, yo, we can't be late<br />
[Thes One:] So, straight, I'll pick you up at seven, dig inside your crate<br />
And find a fresh plate to rotate to make the b-boys get ape<br />
<span class="grey-text">Me and you</span>, the super MCs to get the cake<br />
[Double K:] Word up! I called the posse, we can all roll out<br />
'Cause once we step up in the party, yo, we'll make the ladies shout<br />
People Under The Stairs, yeah, you know we got the clout<br />
Packed up my records, rolled up the blunt<br />
[Thes One:] I grabbed the black book and tried to call up this stunt<br />
She wasn't home, so I paged and left the celly on &quot;roam&quot;<br />
Man, we out into the night, right on Pico<br />
Rolled down the street, stopped at the red light<br />
[Double K:] Kept on going, made a right on Sierra Bonita<br />
Yo Thes, where's your fake ID?<br />
You know, we need a little bit of liquor for the night<br />
[Thes One:] I was born in 1974…<br />
[Double K:] Yeah, right!<br />
[Thes One:] Word! Corona represent just enough to get me screaming<br />
Like them other Latin brothers whose Intoxicated Demons tape<br />
Bumps lovely, we keep it goin, Naimad on deck<br />
The backseat complete, going, going, and jacked<br />
[Double K:] Turned up the beats and hopped on the Ten<br />
Talking loud about the pigeons that we about to see again<br />
Yo, I'm tryin to stop drinking, but nigga passed the cup<br />
This fool Thes is freestyling, almost passed the exit up<br />
[Thes One:] Because the drinking and driving's a guaranteed no-no<br />
'Cause with the bottle in my hand, it's fucking up my rhyme flow<br />
I went right kinda slow at the bottom of the ramp<br />
Ten-car caravan, Undisputed Champ Camp<br />
[Double K:] Pulled up to the place, had to find a parking space<br />
This ugly bitch was looking at us, so I gave her the gas face<br />
[Thes One:] Yo, her friends was butt too, but they jocked this big crew<br />
Told the bitch, &quot;jump in the jeep, I'll take you to the zoo!&quot;<br />
[Double K:] Damn! Yo, man, word, her hair was all big…<br />
They shoulda been at the zoo, though<br />
Got up to the line…<br />
<br />
[Door bitch:] Five dollars, please!<br />
[Double K:] Oh, we're with the DJ!<br />
[Door bitch:] Nope, five dollars, please!<br />
[Double K:] Bitch, we're with the DJ!<br />
[Door bitch:] FIVE DOLLARS, PLEASE!<br />
[Double K:] 'Bout to beat your ass, man…<br />
[Door bitch:] Alright, just let me stamp your hand… Get in there!<br />
<br />
[Double K:]<br />
I was the first one in, and the crew was behind, so I kept on walking<br />
Couldn't waste no time, bumped into this white guy that I knew<br />
He offered me a brew, I was like &quot;fuck it!&quot;, took it to the head<br />
Now I'm through, soggy laugh, roll another one up<br />
This fool Thes is pushing it, pouring gin in my cup, now I'm tore back<br />
Can't walk worth shit, Elad lit the J, and I hit that shit<br />
Took about a hundred pulls, at least that's how it felt<br />
Chilling, <span class="grey-text">went on one</span>, at least that's how it felt<br />
Realized I was buggin', then I saw Mike's pops<br />
Went outside to spark the beedi and relaxed at the spot<br />
Yo, 'til the DJ threw on Tupac, I walked back in and showed the stamp<br />
Felt like I was shot… Oh my God! Saw this brown-skinned cutie<br />
With a big booty, titties big as hell, looked like <span class="grey-text">Tootie</span><br />
&quot;Hey, girl, how you doing? Oh shit, I'll be back<br />
My nigga Thes is on the mic, about to bust <span class="grey-text">another</span> rap.&quot;<br />
<br />
[Double K:] Yo, this fool Thes… Ay, man, you 'bout to rap out…<br />
[Thes One:] Hey, is that Thes?<br />
[Double K:] C'mon, let's show 'em how to do it… Do it, do it!<br />
<br />
[Thes One:]<br />
Mic check, one, two… How do you do, I'm Thes!<br />
The party-honored guest 'cause the crew get blessed<br />
Never have I stressed, ask my man, J Quest<br />
I rock the mic <span class="grey-text">possessed</span> when the beat's compressed<br />
My two-tape reels are analog at best<br />
It's the true b-boy, and that always gets expressed<br />
Pass the Corona, keep two in the ice chest<br />
Pull a girl like a plug 'cause I'm finessed<br />
Find me when I seem sexually represesed<br />
I treat 'em really good 'til they get obsessed<br />
([Double K:] You mean undressed!)<br />
They acting kinda funny, and they get blood test<br />
If they acting ill, I go and take the next best<br />
You MCs be rapping funny, I'm not impressed<br />
Sounding like products of parental incest<br />
But son, my tape's for sale, so I hope you invest<br />
Study up our skills, that's what I suggest<br />
If you think you're fresh, you catch a litmus test<br />
Drop some fresh rhymes, that is my request<br />
You got no heart, let me lay you down to rest<br />
I invoke the hip-hop citizen's arrest<br />
My main- … yo, man!<br />
<br />
[Double K:] Hey, that fool done kicked the cord out!<br />
[Thes One:] Plug me back in, yo!<br />
[Double K:] Hey, what's up? What's up? Man, fuck these motherfuckers!… Let's just break up out. Where the crew? Fuck this… yo, Thes…<br />
([Weak host:] Party's over! Everybody, get the fuck out of my house!)<br />
[Double K:] Yo… Hey, I'm fucked up… I'm fucked up, I can't… Yo, I can't walk… Ay-yo, Naimad!… Nigga… Awww, shit…</p>
