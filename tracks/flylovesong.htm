<h1>Fly Love Song</h1>
<p><strong>Written by: Michael Turner &amp; Christopher Portugal</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>[Thes One:] It's the Fly Love Song…<br />
<br />
[Double K:] Yeah, yeah, yeah… what's up?<br />
[Thes One:] I looked in the mirror the other day, man… saw a grown-ass man… Thinking to myself, man, &quot;What the hell?&quot;… hanging out, sitting on the porch, make beats… I'm still buying records… I play video games… you know what I'm saying? Grown-ass man.<br />
[Double K:] Uh huh? Yeah. Uh huh… Okay… Word, word, word, word, word…. Yeah, hell yeah… so?<br />
<br />
[Thes One:] Got a girlfriend and all…<br />
[Double K:] Oh, okay, okay…<br />
[Thes One:] <span class="grey-text">Not go another four</span>, man…<br />
[Double K:] Yeah, well, you know, I mean, shit…<br />
[Thes One:] Having a real hard time balancing it…<br />
[Double K:] Word?<br />
[Thes One:] Know what I mean?<br />
[Double K:] Yeah.<br />
[Thes One:] Think you're suave, but… <span class="grey-text">I may not</span> know how to do it, man…<br />
[Double K:] <span class="grey-text">I said this…</span> this is no big deal, man.<br />
[Thes One:] I mean, you know… if you could just let me know, like, how you do it and all…<br />
[Double K:] What can I tell you?<br />
[Thes One:] <span class="grey-text">This is you</span>, you know what I'm saying…<br />
[Double K:] Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah…<br />
[Thes One:] I'll just keep making these beats, I don't know...<br />
[Double K:] I mean, tell me what's up, man, tell me what's up…<br />
[Thes One:] Check it out…<br />
<br />
[Thes One:]<br />
Never been the type-a cat to need a lot<br />
Couple of crates, a few beats to rock ([Double K:] Alright…)<br />
I spent my time hanging with the homies on the block<br />
Freestyling, drinking beer, making jokes a lot (ha ha, ha ha)<br />
I take it all for granted, or at least it seems<br />
Held it down while I chased my rap dreams<br />
Had schemes for romancing, lose my chance when<br />
I'd rather make a beat than put on slacks and take her dancing<br />
Travelling overseas and never calling home<br />
Spending anniversaries on cell phones<br />
Now that I'm around, <span class="grey-text">polling it down on her</span> suggestions<br />
<span class="grey-text">'S</span> about becoming stable, man, I need to pay attention to her needs<br />
But indeed, my music calls me, and I come running like a she<br />
One big apology, my homie, I can't seem to see<br />
A healthy balance between hip hop, hard beats, picnics, and Hennessy<br />
Long walks by the sea and time with my MPC<br />
Rhymes, breakbeats, rose petals, and poetry<br />
I'm just trying to be me, man, I love her<br />
And losing her is something I <span class="grey-text">can't see</span><br />
'Cause with her, I <span class="grey-text">can be…</span><br />
<br />
[Double K:] Ay-yo, my mellow, my man, you sound kinda confused… you're mixing it up, you got the wrong ingredients… you need this kind of juice right here…<br />
[Thes One:] Word? Check it out…<br />
([Sung sample:] This is just…)<br />
<br />
[Double K:]<br />
I'm the mayor of Stroke City, president of The Hump<br />
I'm a fan of pretty ladies, funky music, and bubbly<br />
But a brown-skinned breezy'll turn my day hard to easy<br />
Candlelight and Buddha sacks, baby, don't take much to please me<br />
And I tell you, my friend, I met my match the other night<br />
Higher than a constellation, crusing on a smooth bike<br />
I'm a mack like Donald, so I creep and I talk<br />
Jumped off the two-wheel rider, so me and baby can walk<br />
Long story on the short tip, I put it in the socket<br />
Shooting for the chance for her to put my picture in her locket<br />
Oh yeah, I'm romantic, so I walked her home<br />
Told her, I couldn't wait to get her on the phone<br />
We all alone in front of her house, giggling and having a time<br />
Ol' girl was elegant, asked me in for wine<br />
My reply was fine, I was right behind<br />
Exactly where I wanted to be, nobody loved it like me<br />
Gave a toast to her beauty and touched her cheek lightly<br />
Politely, I knew that later, she'd excite me<br />
This might be the best time in her little life<br />
Chilling with a stone-cold player, he does it right<br />
Some girls, they like niggas, some girls, they like dudes<br />
But they all love Double K, let the story conclude<br />
We was getting pretty tipsy and a little more touchy<br />
Feeling in closer, keeping warm like a toaster<br />
I'm supposed to get it, so I got it good<br />
The overweight loving that made her say, &quot;My hood!&quot;<br />
We had a lot in common, homie, and here's the only vice<br />
It had to do with lots of loving, and yo, it ain't nothing nice<br />
<br />
[Double K:] …and then I went home and made a beat!<br />
[Thes One:] Word!<br />
[Double K:] You know what I mean?<br />
[Thes One:] Yeah, hell yeah…<br />
[Double K:] Just… you gotta… combine both of the two…<br />
[Thes One:] Mm-hm, yeah, okay…<br />
[Double K:] And what you get is a fly love song at the end, you know what I mean? C'mon, man, let's drink this beer…<br />
<br />
[Double K:] It got to do with lots of loving<br />
[Thes One:] It ain't nothing nice (repeated and improved)<br />
([Sung sample:] This is just… [repeated])</p>
