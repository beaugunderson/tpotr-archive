<h1>The Fun (Ste. For Peter Pt. 1)</h1>
<p><strong>Written by: Michael Turner &amp; Christopher Portugal</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>[Spoken sample:] Just tell them 'bout all the money you gonna make. 'Cause you know we gonna have album covers, posters…<br />
[Spoken sample:] I'm talking major labels…<br />
[Spoken sample:] That's real fresh, brother…<br />
[Spoken sample:] You gonna be a superstar, you gonna have to check out the style…<br />
[Rap sample:] And they so full of money (repeats)<br />
<br />
[Thes One:]<br />
Stay on the go, yep, comfortable living<br />
I pull up at the stoplight, charitable giving<br />
Sure, wash my windshield, homie, here's a twenty<br />
God bless, no I don't need no change for my money<br />
That's the fruit of my labor, the fresh flavor gives me juice<br />
To pull up in your country any time and get loose like Shibuya<br />
We threw the yen in the air<br />
Gave the girl ten G's just to braid Double's hair<br />
Drank Pocari Sweat, jumped on a jet and went to Stockholm<br />
You suckas stuck in L.A. (Man, I called. Dude, he's not home!)<br />
Hey, my bad! The local lifestyle is too common<br />
I dipped to see the tomb of Mr. Tutankhamun<br />
On the Nile with a smile to Nubia with my lady<br />
We had so much fun, we made a goddamn baby<br />
And now he's here, and we keep him in Carter's gear<br />
When he's old, he'll be Old Money, flower in the boutonniere<br />
For now, we keep his little butt in Montessori<br />
If you bought <em>The Next Step</em>, then you helped write the story<br />
While me and Double K making sucka crews furious<br />
They're at their best, and they're still looking bicurious, pff!<br />
<br />
I try to cop one, in the meantime, uh<br />
I try to cop… but hey<br />
In the meantime, I try to cop one<br />
I try to cop one up in the meantime<br />
But in the meantime, I try to cop one<br />
I try to cop one up in the meantime<br />
In the meantime, ([Double K:] Yeahhh…) I try to<br />
[Both:] Cop one<br />
[Thes One:] And I try to<br />
[Both:] Cop one, but in the meantime<br />
[Thes One:] Because…<br />
<br />
[Both:] The bottom line ([Double K:] Eh, what's that, man?)<br />
Is the dollar sign ([Thes One:] Two times!)<br />
You get yours, yo, and I'll get mine<br />
You get yours, yeah, and I'll get mine<br />
Uh, lookout! The bottom line ([Thes One:] One time!)<br />
Is the dollar sign ([Thes One:] Well, two times!)<br />
You get yours, yo, and I'll get mine<br />
[Thes One:] You get yours, yeah, and I'll get mine, Double K!<br />
([Double K:] Hey… What's going on, man? Uh huh-huh-huh!)<br />
<br />
[Double K:]<br />
Gimme a dub on the black hand, my man<br />
Yeah, I got the tab, baby, here, slide him a gram, word<br />
There's a fan, so I pose and take a flick<br />
He said he want a smoke, so I threw him a brick (here you go, man)<br />
The General of Generosity<br />
Posted in your city center, blowing sacks like a tenor<br />
When I'm in the Netherlands, no matter the weather<br />
Me and my man's get busy, headed for the night shift<br />
At the bar, buying shots for strangers, we living<br />
A toast to the boogie and the P's new movie<br />
You can view it in 3-D and you might see<br />
The exhaust as we take off in New York City<br />
Hit the library, we taking gems off the wall<br />
Pass 'em out to the crowd that night<br />
It's Big Mike, outside in a limo with the bubbly on chill<br />
But first, ignore these young niggas trying to keep it real<br />
We off to Wakiki, flower shirts on the scooter<br />
L.A.-style, puffing on a hooter<br />
We make it rain… nah, man, we hurricane<br />
Long island iced teas, live it up for the Gs<br />
Stuff 'em in my left pocket<br />
See rocket don't smoke, and rocket don't choke<br />
But rocket sure enjoys white wine on the boat<br />
It ain't a fairy tale, we do it very well, so, uh…<br />
<br />
In the meantime, I gotta cop one<br />
I try to cop one, but in the meantime<br />
And in the meantime, I gotta cop one<br />
I'm 'bout to cop one, but<br />
([Thes:] Yeahhh…)<br />
[Both:] In the meantime<br />
([Double K:] Yo…<br />
[Thes One:] Lookout, y'all…)<br />
<br />
[Double K, with intermittent Thes One:]<br />
The bottom line, yeah, is the dollar sign<br />
I said, you get yours, yo, and I'll get mine<br />
You get yours, yo, and I'll get mine<br />
([Thes One:] Uh, lookout!)<br />
The bottom line<br />
([Double K:] What is it my brother?<br />
[Thes One:] Yeah!)<br />
Is the dollar sign<br />
([Double K:] Check it out<br />
[Thes One:] Two times)<br />
You get yours, yo, and I'll get mine<br />
([Double K:] Me and Thes One, we gotta get it… no, we gotta get it…<br />
[Thes One:] You get yours, yo, we gotta... you know, we…)<br />
<br />
[Double K:] Hey, man, how much that cost? Yo, it don't even matter, man… psst… you know what I'm saying? Man, give that nigga a hundred dollars!<br />
<br />
[Rap sample:] <span class="grey-text">Rocks out</span> for some recreation<br />
[Rap sample:] <span class="grey-text">Dressed in suede</span><br />
[Rap sample:] <span class="grey-text">Rocks out</span> for some recreation<br />
[Rap sample:] Gotta spend cash money, keep this game alive<br />
<br />
[Both:] You know we stay on our feet from nine to five<br />
'Cause the boys from the P don't take no jive! Rrrah!</p>
