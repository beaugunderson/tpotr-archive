<h1>Ste. For Reefer</h1> 
<p><strong>Written by: Michael Turner &amp; Christopher Portugal</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>[Double K:]<br />
Yo, live from the West Coast of cornrows and locstas<br />
Live from the bus stop, smell the weed aromas<br />
The Double and Thes, so fresh, we right back<br />
In the lab, in the street, make the cyph...<br />
<br />
[Double K:] Ay-yo, man, fuck all that smooth shit! Mothafuckas know who we are, man. Let's get into some of this rough b-boy shit right here, man. Turn that beat up! [echoes]<br />
<br />
[Thes One:] ...-thletics, head rush, bussin' Jerome Bettis<br />
You rappers dressed up babies, you belong with Anne Geddes in a sunflower<br />
My gunpowder is sun-powered to run cowards right out the saloon<br />
And soon shower with them Acid Raindrops, man, you know the P, we do it<br />
It's Happy Hour at the bar and drinkin' like a Druid<br />
'Cause I came here with stupid and we came to get stupid<br />
Double, grabbed a dumb record out the crate and straight looped it<br />
Same as it ever was, like the Talking Heads<br />
Been rockin' hip-hop shows since the crowd had all dreads<br />
But now we Walking Dead, talkin' 'bout &quot;get the lead out!&quot;<br />
Man, who gives a damn what I said? Let me hear you shout<br />
Man, y'all rappers ain't gettin' paid, least not enough to sell out<br />
The duo hit the stage, and the front row yell out:<br />
(&quot;DOUBLE KAAAAYY!&quot;) Hmmmm... that's who I came with<br />
The People Under The Stairs still bringin' that real shit<br />
Man, y'all rappers ain't gettin' paid, least not enough to sell out<br />
The duo hit the stage, and the front row yell out:<br />
(&quot;DOUBLE KAAAAYY!&quot;) That's who I came with<br />
The People Under The Stairs still bringin' that real shit, man, y'all...<br />
<br />
[Double K:]<br />
Knick knack paddy whack, give a rapper a bone<br />
Naw, don't give him nothing but a funeral home<br />
'Cause when I'm finished with the microphone, suckas will be dethroned<br />
I jump inside of the booth with the wreck of Al Capone<br />
Gunboat diplomacy describes the way I transcribe anger to paper<br />
Got brothas catchin' the vapors like: ([Rap sample:] Nigga, please, you work for UPS!)<br />
You outta here like doobiest, I'm sure your mother told you &quot;do your best&quot;<br />
But you didn't listen, now you stuck with them wack rhymes<br />
A father's ass-whippin' and them dishes in the kitchen<br />
Y'all choir boys, and I'm the reverend on coke<br />
Even if you voted for him, I'm sorry, yo, there's no hope<br />
Just yellow tape, smartphones on the floor<br />
With that last line you wrote that was dumb as a whore<br />
Your homies all scattered, family members are sobbin'<br />
Next time you see the Mike and the Chris, we steady mobbin'<br />
<br />
[Scat sample:] Shoo doo, doop a doo doo<br />
Shoo doo, doop a doo doo<br />
Shoo doo, doop a doo doo<br />
Boop a doo doo, doop a doop a doo (x2)<br />
Shoo doo, doop-...<br />
<br />
[Thes One:]<br />
The P MPC music make emtpy street anthems<br />
My tape keep blastin', holdin' your system ransom<br />
Hot box, handsome on a hill, watchin' night lights stretch<br />
A Los Angeles journalist like Fletch<br />
Somewhat shy of midnight in the city of dreams<br />
I design rhymes similar to Eames<br />
Banana leaf parables written on loose leafs<br />
Extraordinary thought inside of ordinary wreaths<br />
Made of vinyl hangin' on spindles, 33s spinnin'<br />
Like Mr. Wendel on Nintendo in your room winnin'<br />
&quot;(Fuck!) Who let the bums in here!&quot; the industry screams<br />
&quot;They fuckin' smell like beer!&quot; accomplishing dreams<br />
Lead by example, lead by a sample<br />
LEED certified, I recycle out the landfill<br />
Lost U.S. culture, just Baby Boomer thoughts<br />
Stetsa said if we didn't, ([Rap sample:] people could've forgot!)<br />
I'm talkin' all that jazz, psych rock, even prog<br />
Analog underdogs, reppin' city of smog<br />
If I made a million dollars, wouldn't pop a Cristal<br />
Six pack of Sessions, share that shit with my pals<br />
Ay-yo, I'm out...<br />
<br />
[Man #1:] The hell are you doing to my car?<br />
[Man #2:] Hey, beat it, spook. This don't concern you.<br />
[Man #3:] Who you callin' &quot;spook&quot;, peckerwood?<br />
[Man #4:] Hey, hey, listen guys... Look, I don't wanna mess with no reefer addicts, okay?<br />
[Man #3:] Get home to your mama, boy!<br />
[Man #2:] Biff! Hey, Biff!<br />
[Man #5:] Get me outta here! Yo!<br />
[Man #3:] Reginald, where are your keys?<br />
[Man #5:] The keys are in the trunk...<br />
<br />
[Double K:]<br />
My microphone is a three-time felon with nothing to lose<br />
Givin' suckas the blues, same color as my shoes<br />
They only see the bottom of 'em, we standin' above 'em<br />
With the deranged look and a wicked left hook<br />
Rhyme like tsunami, I'm filet mignon, y'all salami<br />
One verse from the Kidd, you cryin' for mommy<br />
You like Tommy, man, ain't got no job<br />
Better check a temp agent or learn how to rob<br />
The most polished like your pop's wingtips, I mean this<br />
The meanest Dapper Dan, loc, I'm the cleanest<br />
Words are like velvet, definition of smooth<br />
Clear my throat, drink a 40, make sure the crowds move<br />
They used to call me insane, now I'm on another plane<br />
Keepin' the piece locked, yes, yes, we don't stop<br />
The return of Cowboy and Melle Mel, givin' 'em hell<br />
And we don't give a fuck if the record don't sell<br />
In control like Marley. Your crew? Hardly...<br />
I'm like a white dude wacked on meth, riding a Harley<br />
Hip hop's Chris Farley, except nothing can harm me<br />
Not even the most wicked concoction of dope<br />
Watch Jesse Jackson give up hope by these bars that I wrote<br />
Los Angeles necktie, I hope you can cope<br />
The beat I grope like a MILF on piff<br />
Too swift, break in your hangout, you can call me &quot;Biff&quot;.<br />
<br />
([Double K:] Is anybody home, McFly? Is anybody home, McFly? Is anybody home, McFly?
[Spoken sample:] Hello? Hello? Is anybody home? Huh?
[Thes One:] Yo, yo...)<br />
<br />
[Thes One:]<br />
This one for ZayZay, young brothers like Bungie<br />
Like Ramadan, dawn to dusk, I'm still hungry<br />
I rep the end of the 110 and Peck Park<br />
Like beer in the brown bag and blunts in the dark<br />
We them latchkey kids, unlocked the fountain of youth<br />
And music saved my life, Mike's too, that's the truth, man<br />
I wouldn't lie, wouldn't die, lyrics live forever<br />
For whomever, a monument like Shuttle Endeavour<br />
In science center my position right off Exposition and Coliseum<br />
The P collect per diem when you see 'em<br />
Being nothing but themselves, bro, nothing to hide<br />
Took this L.A. shit worldwide, jump in the ride and slide with me<br />
Honestly, I'mma be homily, a rappin' anomaly<br />
Probably should've retired by now, wow<br />
Career like a turtle's life span, and I stay slammin' the mic stand<br />
From here to BumFuck, Japan... oh sayonara<br />
Been turned up since ([Rap sample:] okay, Si Gitarra)<br />
Man, motherfuck Drake, I had a Georgetown starter<br />
That I fuckin' got jumped for, I got it for Christmas<br />
But growin' up in L.A., weakest link'll get dismissed<br />
Wore my lower-middle class like a Red Badge Of Honor<br />
You're a goner... Your Honor, I'm guilty, too damn filthy<br />
We the P, motherfuck, don't expect me to go<br />
Yell, 'cause without the P, your shit is just hi_ ho_<br />
<br />
[Spoken sample:] Uh... okay, Biff. Well, I'll, uh... I'll finish that on up tonight, and then I'll, uh... bring it over first thing tomorrow morning.</p>
