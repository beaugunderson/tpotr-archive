<h1>Los Angeles Daze</h1>
<p><strong>Written by: Michael Turner &amp; Christopher Portugal</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>[Double K:] Check it… People Under The Stairs… Double K…<br />
[Both:] Thes One…<br />
[Double K:] Putting it down… the way it should be…<br />
[Thes One:] For two…<br />
[Double K:] The way it should've been…<br />
[Thes One:] L.A. style…<br />
[Double K:] We gonna do it…<br />
[Thes One:] The West style…<br />
[Double K:] Me and Thes…<br />
[Thes One:] Hip-hop…<br />
[Double K:] You… Two, one…<br />
[Thes One:] For everybody…<br />
<br />
[Sung sample:] Ask why and <span class="grey-text">we're be so while</span>…<br />
<br />
[Rap samples:] 'Cause I'm rough and I'm tough…<br />
In a b-boy stance… and I come from L.A. (x2… then scratched together)<br />
<br />
[Double K:]<br />
Crescent Heights city, yeah, that's where I'm from<br />
A gang of wild-ass niggas that don't back down <span class="grey-text">to run</span><br />
<span class="grey-text">And</span> supposed to perpetrate on <span class="grey-text">bustas</span> that we putting it down<br />
These so-called L.A. fools that ain't nowhere to be found<br />
I see you throwing up the &quot;W,&quot; but yo, I'm here to trouble you<br />
Of what you listening to-1-3, and that's 3-1-0, not 3-1-3, so get it right…<br />
Bust it… yo, we makin' dope like Hoover and Pico, move slow<br />
Be polite and everything'll be alright, despite what other niggas say<br />
Yo, this where it at, them other West Coast faggots, yo, where they at?<br />
Word to MC Ren, I showed them people that you wack<br />
Peace to the real crews defacing walls on backstreets<br />
In the city of set, <span class="grey-text">porch, halls</span>, and swap meets<br />
From the school of hard knocks, the generation passed down<br />
Kaiser Permanente, yo, that's where I was found<br />
In the middle of the funk era, frozen dashikis<br />
Pops was putting it down, chilling at the speakeasy<br />
Now I'm posting at Unity with the b-boy stance (word!)<br />
Check your pants and keep walking, yo, you know who it is<br />
I'm from the motherfucking hardest-working group in show biz<br />
If your shit ain't humping right, don't even bring it this way<br />
You get booed off the stage, leaving town the next day<br />
Telling your boys, &quot;It is aight, better luck next time<br />
The only thing that was cool: the weed, women, and sunshine&quot;<br />
Forgot to look under the stairs, yo, much more to boast about<br />
Trying to diss and get that ass knocked out<br />
<br />
[Thes One:]<br />
Thes born in South America, moved to South Bay<br />
Run with a crew from Mid-City, that's where I stay<br />
I'm from L.A., always have been, and always will be capitol<br />
<span class="grey-text">The sprawled up piece</span> stands out like palm trees<br />
Next to pine trees, blowing in the Santa Ana breeze<br />
My DJ's got fame, underground Rick Dees<br />
I am MC, so bring in fuck in five minutes<br />
I jam like the 110 in the '84 Olympics<br />
Keep the rhyme moving like the Unity location<br />
Rap has been my vocation<br />
Since before the Japanese owned the radio station<br />
That's why they Fired Jay Thomas<br />
I keep it fattened like the llama, yo, I promise<br />
Never stop, never change, like the price at Dodger Stadium<br />
I blow up, rock free shows at the Palladium<br />
Afterwards, the crew I'm taking 'em to Tommy's Burgers<br />
Gotta be for every Los Angelino Murder<br />
A rhyme for every burglar, Thes a <span class="grey-text">well-worder</span><br />
It comes together in a freeway like East LA merger<br />
That means you'll get no pay, but I urge you<br />
Keep ya eye on L.A. like Chuck Henry, word<br />
You heard of someone better? Send 'em our way<br />
He get done the L.A. Way, the drive-by way…<br />
<br />
[Rap samples:] 'Cause I'm rough and I'm tough…<br />
In a b-boy stance… and I come from L.A. (all scratched together)<br />
<br />
[Thes One:]<br />
Check it… everyone in my town think they got flows<br />
Thes serve more wack MCs than waitresses at Roscoe's<br />
You know me, at the graveyard shift, gettin spliffed<br />
We can take it downtown like Figueroa and 5th<br />
And after that, I'm heading up to El Cholo for some dinner<br />
Bustin' through the inner-city underground like the red line<br />
Thinner than the line at <span class="grey-text">car wash</span> in El Niño<br />
That's you son, see no time in this locale<br />
Underground, down, talking 'bout, &quot;Yo, I'm keepin it real!&quot;<br />
I'm coming with the Walkman and tapes, not steel<br />
Not a .22, .45, <span class="grey-text">but a</span> 9, Double O, 6<br />
Put it on your letter to the better, lick a stamp, send it<br />
And mail a letter to Thes, L.A. legend like Fernando Valenzuela<br />
Yes, he never ran in a battle, yes<br />
He be smoking beedis, watching the sun set from Sunset<br />
<br />
[Double K:]<br />
Ay-yo, we got rappers walking around, shook like earthquakes<br />
Blame it on San Andreas, it was a fault you had to wait<br />
To grab the steel, how you feel? Ain't even got skills to represent<br />
The City of Angels, my whole team is heaven sent<br />
Getting shit accomplished, yo, check the way we rock this<br />
Like the Raiders in '88, fool, you can't stop us<br />
Like gang-banging, this shit'll be banging for centuries<br />
Imperial groups spreading like bank robberies<br />
Over the Southland, we put the funk in your trunk<br />
To bump hard, like 808s, sorry you had to wait<br />
But we was digging in the crates, no fear, it's here<br />
Shady like MacArthur Park, don't get caught after dark<br />
Might never come back, see, sometimes it's like that<br />
Some niggas carry a gat, some niggas use their head<br />
But the smartest of the smartest'll still come out dead<br />
It's true it ain't where you're from, it's where you're at<br />
But you'll still get caught up wearing the wrong colored-hat<br />
And on that note, everybody shut the fuck up and kick it<br />
Spliffted, whatever you do, make sure you don't miss it<br />
'Cause we coming like the end, yo, it's just about wax<br />
So watch out, we bringing bad luck like Wilshire and Fairfax<br />
And it's just like that, so check it out…<br />
<br />
[Rap samples:] 'Cause I'm rough and I'm tough…<br />
In a b-boy stance… and I come from L.A. (all scratched together)<br />
<br />
[James Brown:] &quot;Fred, where you from?&quot;<br />
[Fred Wesley:] &quot;L.A.&quot;<br />
[James Brown &amp; others:] &quot;Uh oh, uh oh! Uh oh! Ask him where he started from…&quot;<br />
[Spoken sample:] California… (repeats)</p>
