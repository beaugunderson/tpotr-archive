<h1>Crown Ones</h1>
<p><strong>Written by: Michael Turner &amp; Christopher Portugal</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>[Thes One:]<br />
Dig the underground sound like an approaching earthquake<br />
Golden-State's plate vibrate eights, your chunks shake<br />
We rock crowns, fitted the sound, get down with it<br />
Swing the scepter soul, the jesters know they bit it<br />
I see them smile through the argyle and good humor<br />
But them ice-cream 16 bars are rap tumors<br />
But YoYoPo ruminates, things are getting great now<br />
Hop the lake, jump a train, just to checkmate<br />
How we make a pawn, take a long pause, and ain't no moving back<br />
One square at a time, dropping dimes on the white and black<br />
Well, we stay the course on this high horse, moving in big L's<br />
She may have a one-track mind, but she selling sea shells<br />
Big power like D-cells, we retail the unexpected<br />
A little this, little that, recipe's perfected<br />
So if you see the hat, then get set<br />
Double K rap, breathing down yo' neck<br />
<br />
[Double K:]<br />
It's the P, the funky Lone-Star Strangers<br />
Go for your buns, we in the house, there's danger<br />
Tell the DJ to screw it, slow your body on down<br />
Party on to the last word I mentioned, attention:<br />
All hip-hopping, back is the bass, dropping under the street light<br />
Copping the funk, now tell me whats up<br />
We on your mixtape and do it for a fixed rate<br />
Getting straight to it, no foreplay, just floor play<br />
Skank your shoes off, and thank your new boss:<br />
The workout Jim! The brother ain't slim<br />
But I'm the thin line between funking and fronting<br />
Come to your jam, eat your chips (mmm!), grab the mic<br />
Double split and then rip (Heh heh heh… right)<br />
There ain't no half-stepping, that's what I told Big Daddy Kane<br />
And I bet you somewhere, it's still stuck in his brain<br />
You can't forget it, it's a given, and we taking it back<br />
Like Pack Jam, you'll be, like, &quot;That jam was bumpin'!&quot;<br />
Old ladies be, like, &quot;Them boys sure are something!&quot;<br />
The Latin brothas say, &quot;Órale!&quot;, and let the jam play<br />
It's a down one, so when you see me walk up and crown one<br />
You can crown one (you can crown one)…<br />
<br />
[Sung sample:] You can't take the crown<br />
Maybe from someone else but not me! (x2)<br />
<br />
[Thes One:]<br />
Can't mess with these heavyweights, twisted for the tracking late<br />
Youth Explosion back cover made the funk levitate<br />
You were posing like, &quot;It's cool!&quot;, dude, we went and rocked your school<br />
Master tools like Mr. Taylor catering the parlez-vous<br />
Money-making microphone Macco-paints the Plymouth<br />
Catch a vibe like Earl Sheib, spray 'em 'til we finish it<br />
Bodyshopping, body-rocking, block party characters<br />
Those seeming scared of the P are non-perilous<br />
'Cause he's the terrible terrorist, tearing through your cannabis<br />
And Thes'll manhandle those grandstanding Los Angeles producers<br />
We superconductors with bumper crops<br />
Grow 'em like I-5 high fives, brothers call 'em &quot;slumper props&quot;<br />
Talk a lot, but check the disc like RCA puppies<br />
We rock it for you ghetto fresh, we rock it for you yuppies<br />
You talk a lot, but check the disc like RCA puppies (We rock it…)<br />
…that's right dog!<br />
<br />
[Double K:] (Huh… check it out…)<br />
It's the return of the one-nation-under-a-groover (mm-hm…)<br />
The young-girl soother, the baby-batter mover (alright…)<br />
I'm down with the maneuver, do it right-to-left<br />
The hero in stereo, some call me imperial<br />
The baller without the '64 Impala<br />
I can take the picture on a dollar, flip it, turn and make it holla back<br />
Younging, microphone thugging, come off that rap<br />
You a BG tripping, and we them OG's bugging<br />
Loving every minute of it, wouldn't put nothing above it<br />
But them folks upstairs, so they can feel the bass boom<br />
Give the ladies waist room, wind up your boom-boom<br />
Brought the funk out the tomb for the ([Spoken sample:] Resurrection!)<br />
Thes One and Double K of the 808 section<br />
We arrange and conduct, you get the finished product<br />
Jumping off the shelves, be the jam of the year<br />
The People Under The stand clear, it's a world premier…<br />
<br />
[Sung sample:] You can't take the crown<br />
Maybe from someone else but not me! (x4)<br />
Not me… (x6)<br />
<br />
[Spoken sample:] Is your son named Joe Bwabwawawawa? Yeah. I'm sorry, he's dead, miss. Right? Yeah, and then… and then you got little kids come in and go: [beatboxes] understand it, it's funky…</p>
