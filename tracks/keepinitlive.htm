<h1>Keepin It Live</h1> 
<p><strong>Written by: Michael Turner &amp; Christopher Portugal</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>[Double K, with gibberish argument sounds behind him:] Nigga, what you mean &quot;I ain't making no money off this hip-hop shit&quot;? Yeah, I know this is all I do is stay up and make beats. You know, this is how we make our living, this is what the people want us to do… Nah, I'm not gonna get a job there, and I'm not gonna work there, and all that <span class="grey-text">yak</span>… fuck it. Hey, come over here, let's listen to Thes One…<br />
<br />
[Thes One:] (Check it out…)<br />
It was me and Double K in my room in '95<br />
Beatboxing on the mic, recording the tape live [Double K beatboxing]<br />
Before we arrived on the scene, you know what I mean<br />
When it was all about… I forgot, man, forget it<br />
See, now the P is sweated as a global affair<br />
But it seems those closest to me seem the least to care<br />
When it was &quot;Rah-rah, y'all can do it!&quot; back in the day<br />
Now it's like 3 albums deep and &quot;When are you getting paid?&quot;<br />
My records are played, I sleep smiling every night<br />
But when I wake up, it's something else, a whole new fight<br />
Like cats double-crossing me that I try to help out<br />
If it wasn't for me and Double, that shit wouldn't come out<br />
So recognize who's the guys devoting their life to it<br />
Sacrificed stability to flex our ability, crew the iller artillery<br />
I can't chill until we fufill the plan of having mics in the hand<br />
The sole reason I was cast down on this land<br />
Is to sit in front of the MPC and turn the bland into the flambé<br />
Things to play to make your day, same shit 10 years ago I'm doing today<br />
And 10 years from now, so don't ask how or even why<br />
B-boy for life, fuck a suit and a tie<br />
'Cause I'll know I made a difference on the day that I die<br />
Ay-yo, I'm B-boy for life, so fuck a suit and a tie<br />
<br />
[Double K:] Yeah… I feel you, man… she be talking that ol' bullshit, you know… you know, &quot;maybe you should get out and go get a job,&quot; you know, or- or, &quot;we can't spend enough time,&quot; you know what I'm saying, man? Just like you, Big Thes, man, I'mma spend all my life try to do this hip-hop shit… fuck it!<br />
[Thes One:] Think it was like '95… '96…<br />
<br />
[Double K:] (When I…)<br />
Perfected my track skills on the SP<br />
Murdered 10 seconds in a minute, peers couldn't get it<br />
Mike was walking on water, my brother, you shoulda seen it<br />
Got ate up in some rap battles, I'm here to redeem it<br />
Like a raincheck hustler, scoping the <span class="grey-text">aisles</span><br />
Jotting lyrics, making beats, just to keep it on file<br />
Whether ADAT, Zip, or floppy, never coming sloppy<br />
No reason to copy niggas, I'm dope, so go figure<br />
Not conceited, nigga, I'm confident when I'm dropping it<br />
Hold the microphone firm, let the lyrics burn<br />
Like the Buddha to the sherm, I'm mellow with one word<br />
Two letter Ks, bringing better days when I bust<br />
Stay grounded with my head in the clouds, and that's a must<br />
You know, just a piece in my hip-hop black book<br />
Outlining the track, y'all watch for the hook<br />
Filling in my ideas, here to keep your style shook<br />
Never rapping like <span class="grey-text">bigots</span> just to be in the game<br />
I'm coming from the inside 'til y'all remember my name<br />
Yo, it's the K-Dub, trouble-bringing notorious one<br />
Couldn't be stopped, keeping these sucka crews on the run<br />
Ya dig it? No matter what y'all say, do, or know<br />
It's me and Thes One, maintaining the…<br />
<br />
[Double K:] Uh… you know how it goes, man… it's me and Thes One, like always, it's two of us… keeping it live, keeping it fresh… I don't know, man… sometimes, I just feel like I can't take it no more, man, like we just gonna bust back, you know, <span class="grey-text">back rapping, back grabbing</span>, yeah… yeah… we backpacking… back rapping and slapping all you fools in the face… you're just a… you're just a… just a disgrace to the… to the… to the… yeah, I like how that sounds right there, man… that's real, real mellow, real jazzy, like, ya dig? Out… word out… out… word up, word up… out… word up… Thes One… and, uh, the Double… hip hop, and my man, and… yeah… step hop and he in the house… ye-yeah… wi-with the Double… and The-es, he in the house, yeah… we all in the house, whatever, we never leaving to the beat's through… yeah, nigga sucka!<br />
<br />
[Audience sample:] Yeah, boy! Rock on! Ooow whoo! C'mon!</p>
