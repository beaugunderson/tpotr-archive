<h1>Wannabes</h1>
<p><strong>Written by: Michael Turner &amp; Christopher Portugal</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>[Song sample:]<br />
Do you know your identity?<br />
How do you know your identity? (x3)<br />
Are you... you wannabe? (x4)<br />
<br />
[Thes One:]<br />
A wise man will only be useful as a man<br />
He will not submit to <span class="grey-text">be clay or stop a hole</span> to keep the wind away<br />
A hundred percent me, capital B-Boy, the child is the father of the man<br />
Taking pictures with my family, the b-boy stance in '84<br />
Grew up cross-threading hip-hop and Peruvian folklore<br />
Therefore, my indifference to pop stems from the fact<br />
The plan to make a difference in hip-hop as an art, not as income<br />
No I didn't come into this shit in '93 like a wannabe<br />
Repressed <span class="grey-text">buyer, high addresses</span> to the liar<br />
That's claiming he did this and that, cat used to diss rap back in '86<br />
Now he wanna mix, make beats, et cetera<br />
It's better to watch and try and prove, <span class="grey-text">it down and read</span> thoughts<br />
Can tell what wannabes are, <span class="grey-text">just</span> everything they're not<br />
Noun, pronoun, now verb, the clown's hard to prove<br />
Reserved, no action got served, my faction that's a fraction<br />
Of my nation, in fact, when I face them, <span class="grey-text">the ice chips</span><br />
I shadow-battle <span class="grey-text">to free give</span>, it's natural to me<br />
Never respect blatant wannabes that follow a model<br />
Like <span class="grey-text">kid could mention us to</span> make MC like Michael McDonald<br />
Now grab the bottle, drink away the fact that you'll always be wack<br />
I got no time for fakin' jacks, 'cause <span class="grey-text">mother</span> got fake jacks are just the…<br />
<br />
[Song sample:] Are you... you wannabe? (x2)<br />
<br />
[Double K:]<br />
Check it out, y'all… yo…<br />
My shit's 1-5-8-0 proof, the realness bringing the truth to light<br />
Ready to fight for my peeps, man, fuck your color lines<br />
Fool, let's take it to the street, radio stations giving a fuck<br />
About you, me, or anybody else that ain't posted on TV<br />
Monday nights, you be in the house getting dumb<br />
While my <span class="grey-text">bitches</span> on the street, making civilians run<br />
Panicked, couldn't stand the way we flipped the script<br />
I know you like the way I got my johnson on your lip<br />
You nickel-dick biter, exciter of the next<br />
Don't wanna come original, just known as a wack individual<br />
Stay in your cipher, dude, I'll stay inside mine<br />
It ain't enough time for <span class="grey-text">getting 'bout it</span> in rhymes<br />
If you doubted it, <span class="grey-text">I'm 'bout</span> it on the dee-lo, chump<br />
I only let my kids know, never put it in the flow<br />
That's where y'all fucked up, putting that shit on the waves<br />
Representing Unity, get the shit out my way<br />
Yo, who in the motherfuck handed you the mic<br />
You came to the club with intentions of rocking it all night<br />
But we scheduled other plans, I'm sorry my man<br />
Just can't take it when niggas like yourself get on the mic and fake it<br />
Been having too long like the <span class="grey-text">(?)</span> first song<br />
When they asked you to rap, you shoulda told 'em <span class="grey-text">you're wrong</span><br />
<br />
[Thes One:]<br />
Everybody wants to be somebody else<br />
A wannabe who's running from the reality of theirself<br />
The national health, I guess, this is symptomatic<br />
Effect of industry, capitalism, and democratic illusions<br />
Take a state like Cali, white kids listen to Death Row<br />
And do drive-bys in Simi Valley<br />
Bump the niggas shit, I guess, it used to be <span class="grey-text">on trial</span><br />
Went from commentary to a way to glorify the industry,<br />
<span class="grey-text">Be</span> saying &quot;nigga&quot; cool, and making believe<br />
That you love the poverty and don't ever want to leave<br />
You wannabe honestly, honestly, the country wants it this way<br />
You wannabe intelligent, now that would cause some dismay<br />
For he wannabe <span class="grey-text">(?)</span>, a player's called a player<br />
She wannabe loved, the <span class="grey-text">famous</span> wannabe the mayor<br />
The mayor's son bought a gun, he wannabe a gangsta<br />
Shanked him in the alley in the dumpster by the bank<br />
'Cause a wannabe's an anomaly for nothing (damn!)<br />
I don't wannabe a b-boy because I am<br />
'98, y'all, People Under The Stairs<br />
<br />
[Song sample:] Are you... you wannabe? (x2)<br />
<br />
[Double K:] Let's peep out these hos, man…<br />
[Thes One:] The real MCs…<br />
<br />
[Double K:]<br />
Now, look at you, fake lady… wannabe<br />
But never gonna be 'cause you ain't got the quality<br />
It ain't like I'm too good for you, more like you're too legit to quit<br />
Got a job <span class="grey-text">slanging</span> ass-to-mouth and the tits<br />
Not even for a fee, dumb bitch, you buggin'<br />
Every other minute, it's another nigga you hugging<br />
I'm buggin'? You need to check your resumé and get it right<br />
From the left, all you see is mean mugs all night<br />
'Cause we ain't going for it, I see your gameplan, bitch<br />
You wanna be like her, instead your one big glitch<br />
I remember high school, you turned your homework in on time<br />
Now you fucking every dude to <span class="grey-text">say</span> their bus pass <span class="grey-text">rhymes</span><br />
But I dropped mad dimes and exposed the fake<br />
At five o' clock, it's Ricki Lake then you off to the <span class="grey-text">breaks</span><br />
To catch another, smoke a little herb, drink a little liquor<br />
You and your girls competing who can get their next quicker<br />
<br />
[Double K:] Wannabes, wannabes, they all in types<br />
Backpacks, baggy pants, &quot;hey, man, you got a pipe?&quot;<br />
Wannabes, wannabes, they all over the place<br />
You can spot 'em anywhere just by the look on their face<br />
[Thes One:] Wannabes, wannabes, honestly, they're confused<br />
Thousand-dollar jumpsuits, snakeskin shoes<br />
Wannabes, wannabes, got no memories<br />
You weren't down back then, you're not down with me<br />
(repeat)<br />
<br />
[Thes One:]… in '98… in '93… in '83… or in '77<br />
[Double K:] You's a wanna-wannabe, a wannabe… you won't slam… you wannabe… you wannabe… you try and make jams…<br />
<br />
[Rap sample:] You won't slam…<br />
Wannabes… wannabes on their knees, lickin' crazy butt… </p>
