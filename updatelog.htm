<h1>Site Update Log</h1>
<hr/>

Added album page, lyrics pages, and updated cross-references for Step 1 of <a href="/albums/tgos.htm">The Gettin' Off Stage</a>.<br />

BIG UPDATE: Transitioned most weblinks and banners from the (now-defunct) PL70 website over to the new <a href="http://www.puts.band/" target="_blank">PUTS website</a> (still need to get rid of the "BUY NOW" ones though), made a number of link &amp; graphics edits to the main page and side bars, split off the compilation albums from the 10 &quot;official&quot; albums, made a page for the incremental <a href="/albums/americanmen2.htm">American Men Vol. 2</a> Soundcloud release, and transcribed the first AMV2 track, released today. Next up on the list (I hope): stay tuned for lyrics to Family Circus &amp; 10 Years of Thes One. I'm also planning on relacing the "BUY NOW" PL70 links with iTunes/Amazon Music/Google Play links.<br />
<br />
